% Results and Discussion: present and discuss findings, look at which goals were achieved and which weren't, discuss further explorations.

% R: You should begin to think about what graphs and figures are going to go in this chapter, and you could even start to put in placeholders for these.

% The discussion is almost an inverse of the introduction -- staring with your main results, how do these complement and extend previous work, what is the relevance for natural systems (i.e. do these models shed light on the actual mechanisms?).
