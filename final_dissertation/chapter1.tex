% Introduction: the background, aims, objectives and constraints in more detail and summarise the remaining chapters
% - the aim is to find a model that balances between achieving good diversity and remaining as simple as possible.
% - one constraint is the ability to enumerate pattern diversity.

% R: Think about the introduction as a funnel that starts wide and narrows down to your aim (patterns are widespread in natural systems, models provide a way to understand how patterns form, the aim of this project was to implement  a subset of these models and examine some of they properties).

% Make sure your aim is carefully written and focussed -- remember this is a dissertation project, not a 10 year research programme :-)
