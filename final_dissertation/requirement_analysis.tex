% Requirements and Analysis: state objectives and break into steps. Discuss possible methods other than what was implemented. Discuss testing and evaluation.
% - not sure what this means in our case, do they want us to discuss the algorithm at this point or is that design?
% - probably discuss the method in the previous email for testing and evaluation.

% R: Based on your analysis in the Lit Review, describe the equations you need to solve, how you plan to solve them numerically (i.e. by approximation), what the limitations are (i.e. the need to meed the stability criterion), how you plan to display the results. Also, how you plan to do your experiments where the model parameters are varied, and how you classify and quantify the model outputs.
