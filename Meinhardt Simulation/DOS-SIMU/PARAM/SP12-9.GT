The first set of simulations shows that an activator-inhibitor system can
generate a cell-internal signal that can be reliable oriented by a minute
external asymmetry. However, after it is once established, it cannot be
reoriented. External signal = blue; activator = green, inhibitor = red

Due to the random fluctuations, the peak may point not exactly in the
direction of the maximum. The orientation of the pattern works with very
different concentrations. In the following simulation the external signal
is much lower:
ca=.0012

n
#
However, even a much stronger signal with a much stronger asymmetry
cannot reorient a once established cell-internal pattern (note that
the cell copes with the higher external signal by increasing level of
the antagonist).

Thus, the problem is not the sensitivity against the external signal
but the maintenance of the sensitivity once the cell-internal pattern is
formed. One possible solution is an oscillation: the cell cycles through
sensitive phases that are followed by the amplification step....

#
Thus, oscillations allow an adaptation in certain time interval.
Experimentally it was observed, however, that the cells remain permanently
sensitive and that usually more than one protrusion forms at the time..

the range of the inhibitor is smaller than the total area...

However, in such a mode, the detection of a gradient is no longer possible.
In the following simulation, a maximum appears also at the side opposite to
the highest signal concentration, abolishing any chemotactic orientation.

#
Therefore, multiple protrusions cannot result from a limited range of
the antagonist; the mutual competition has to cover the whole cell
cortex, leading only to a single maximum. Without activator diffusion and
saturation of the autcatalysis, this maximum is very sharp...

A saturation of the autocatalysis leads to a larger activated region.
Its character depend on the strength of the signal, on activator diffusion,
influences of random fluctuations and the degree of saturation. Without
random fluctuations a large coherent region emerges...

#
In the absence of random fluctuations, only a single coherent and extendet
activated region appears. With fluctuations, however, those regions that
have due to the combined action of the signal and of the fluctuations the
best condition, will win. Several maxima can appear ...

Permanent adaptation: a second antagonistic reaction of short range and with
a long time constant leads to a permanent destabilization of once formed
maxima. Since the total activated area is constant, any local maximum that
disappears makes place for a new one, possible at a more optimal position...

The following simulations account for the observation that in Dictyostelium,
in the absence of signals originating from nearby cells, protrusions are
formed in a non-random fashion. Either oscillations out of phase or
travelling waves around the cell do occur (Killich et al., 1993; 1994).
#
In the absence of an external asymmetry, the long range antagonistic reaction
(depleted substrate, grey) can be insufficient to repress a second maximum.
Two maxima appear at opposite positions. These becomes poisoned by a long
lasting inhibitor (red). After a while, oscillation in counter phase emerge..
