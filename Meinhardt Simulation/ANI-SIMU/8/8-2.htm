<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The short signal that should lead to transition
into pulse-like activation (fine red lines&nbsp; in the upper part of the
simulation at right) may be frequently insufficient and the activation
(brown) reappears immediately. If successful, however, the sudden pigment
termination would lead to a white triangle. This is relatively frequent
in small areas, giving rise to the small triangles. It may also occur,
although more rarely, over a larger area leading to large triangles. The
resulting patterns are similar to the well known Sierpinsky triangle with
its fractal geometry. These structures are self-similar. The triangle below
results from an iterative process in which three&nbsp; more elementary
triangles are combined to a new triangle that is subsequently is rescaled
(detailed information for Sierpinsky triangles are available in the world-wide
web).</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><i>a, b </i>= an activator-substrate system
for the pigmentation. The bistable steady state results from&nbsp; the
high production rate bb and the high removal rate rb of the substrate.&nbsp;</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><i>c, d</i>: The modifying oscillation
is also assumed to be an acitvator-substrate reaction. The components are
assumed to be homogeneously distributed in the whole animal by a hormonal
spread.&nbsp;</font>

bd =.05&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The white triangles result from a block
of substrate production during the oscillation; sb = 2.4. The resulting
patterns are parameter-sensitive. The figures at bottom are calculated
with sb = 2.5 and 2.3 respectively.&nbsp;</font></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Again, these simulations are very parameter-sensitive.
A stronger block of substrate production leads to a dramatically higher
rate for the transition from a high to a low steady state. This suggests
that other regulatory mechanisms exist that maintain the average pigmentation
density by a more global control.</font>
