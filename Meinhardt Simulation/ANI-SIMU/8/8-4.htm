<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>The ambiguity between triangles
and branching lines</font></font></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The two shells below left are of the same
species. One displays triangles, the other branched lines. On the shell
at right, both patterns are visible on the same shell, with branches formed
at the younger and triangles at older age. This coexistence is very remarkable
since both pattern elements require contradictory parameter changes by
a modifying reaction. As explained above, branch formation requires the
temporary transition into a steady state. If the pigmentation reaction
remains active for a sufficiently long time interval, a backwards-running
waves can be triggered (see, for instance, <i><a href="../6/6-1.htm">Oliva
porphyria</a></i>). This occurs if temporary either the activator obtains
a longer half-life or the antagonistic reaction a shorter half-life. In
contrast, as explained in this chapter, triangle formation requires that
normally the cells remain in a spreading steady state. A short pulse of
a modifying reaction shifts the pigmentation system from the steady state
mode into a pulse-like mode, causing the large-scale breakdown. Thus, while
branch formation needs a temporary transition from the traveling wave into
the steady state mode, triangle formation requires exactly the opposite.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These conflicting requirements can be resolved
under the assumption that both modifications, extinguishing and enhancement,
occur in rapid succession. So far, we have assumed that the activator of
the modifying system (red horizontal lines) shortens the half-life of the
pigment activator, causing a transition from a steady state to a pulse-like
activation. The branching phenomenon suggests that the antagonist of the
modifying reaction, for instance an inhibitor (green horizontal lines in
the figures below), plays the opposite role in this modification. While
the short pulse of the activator acts as an extinguishing signal to form
the lower border of the triangle, the longer lasting inhibitor that immediately
follows shifts the pigment system into the&nbsp; steady state mode.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the figure above, it is assumed that
the unperturbed pigmentation reaction remains in a steady state. The activator
of the oscillating reaction shortens the half-life of the pigment reaction,
causing termination and the lower edge of the triangle. The rapidly following
high inhibitor concentration has the opposite effect, elongating the half-life
of the pigment activator. This brings the system rapidly back to the steady
state. In this simulation, the frequent termination at the inner side of
the triangles result from the accumulation of an inhibitor (<i>e</i> in
the equation below). In cells that were more recently activated have a
reduced chance to survive the next breakdown. Without this inhibition,
the whole shell would become covered with connected triangles:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So much for the triangles. What about branches?
Oblique lines are formed if the ratio of the time constants in the pigment
reaction is such that only a pulse-like activation is possible that spreads
in a wave-like manner. The short reduction in the activator half-life will
go almost unnoticed&nbsp; while its subsequent elongation by the inhibitor
can lead to the initiation of branches:</font>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Comparing the branch-simulations above
with natural patterns reveals a characteristic difference: many oblique
lines end blindly, especially if two lines are close to each other. This
requires a modification that is described on the next page.</font>
