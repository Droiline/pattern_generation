<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The most surprising feature of connected
triangles is the almost immediate spread of pigmentation after a collective
breakdown - the bottom side of the triangle. Usually there is no lag between
the breakdown and the spread of pigmentation into the same region again.
Thus, the signal for a transition from the steady state to the pulse-wise
mode and back to the steady state of pigment formation must be very short.
The system returns to its normal condition of bistable activation very
rapidly. This tells us that the antagonistic reaction must have a very
short time constant&nbsp; such that the new steady state is found rapidly
even after such a severe event as the large-scale breakdown. A similar
feature was mentioned for <i><a href="../6/6-1.htm">Oliva porphyria</a></i>
in connection with the branching of lines. In that case, backward waves
proceeded immediately after their birth with the same speed as the original
wave, although they were in the shadow of the primary wave.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A consequence of such a short time constant
of the antagonist is that a spontaneous trigger of a new chain of triangles
is not explicable by the minimum model (and did not occur in the simulations
given on the preceding pages). This phenomenon – an example is given on
the shell above – indicates that a second, longer lasting antagonist is
at work. If it is, for instance, an inhibitor, its disappearance is the
precondition to trigger the pigmentation again after a longer pause, initiating
one or two diverging chains of triangles.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="s-sponti.gif" height=287 width=294></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As shown in the simulation above, the employment
of a second,&nbsp; long-ranging antagonist (pink in the simulation above)
solves another problem. The pattern can arise spontaneously. It does not
require local initiation sites since the long-ranging inhibitor can accomplish
the initiating pattern formation. Moreover, in a chain of triangles, one
side of the triangle was exposed more recently to an activation. Thus,
this side experiences a higher inhibition. Therefore, the other side of
the triangle has a better chance to survive the breakdown. This contributes
to the formation of long chains of oblique triangles.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With this long-ranging inhibition, the
condition for <a href="../5/5-4.htm">crossings and branching</a> are satisfied
as discussed in chapter 5. Actually a closer inspection of the patterns
discussed in chapter 5 shows the involvement of&nbsp; an oscillating pattern
that is visible in the relief-like modulation of the shell surface. The
merging of two such horizontal lines on the shell shown in the center indicates
that this oscillation is nearly but not completely synchronous. The lower
edges of the triangular fine structure coincide with the fine lines of
the horizontal surface structure.</font>
