<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several mollusks display triangles as basic
pattern element. The triangles may be connected to each other to form oblique
lines with a triangular substructure. If both corners of the lower edge
give rise to new triangles, the white regions in between also have a triangular
shape although with opposite orientation. The triangles may cover different
portions of the shell. If they are densely packed, it appears as if white
triangles are arranged on a black background. The triangles can also be
of very different sizes. On some shells they are a prominent pattern element,
on others they appear more as a roughness in the oblique lines but are
clearly visible on closer inspection. The figure below shows a selection:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Triangles result when</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(i) pigment production is bistable and
can be either in a high or low state. At the high state, the pigment production
spreads with constant speed.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(ii)&nbsp; After a certain time interval
an abrupt termination occurs almost simultaneously over whole active regions.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since the termination occurs in many cases
simultaneously at distant regions of the shell, the termination cannot
be the consequence of a fast spreading reaction (as in <i><a href="../7/7-2.htm">Conus
marmoreus</a></i>) but must occur from a global event like a hormone production.
Therefore, a global oscillation (red) is assumed that blocks pigment reaction,
either by suppressing the necessary substrate production, or by increasing
activator removal. Due to the short pulse, the pigmentation may shift from
the high to the low steady state. Activation can survive at the margins
of the activated regions since sufficient substrate is still available
there. In the time record this leads to a pattern of connected triangles.</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These simple models are parameter-sensitive.
An increase of 10% in the rate of activator removal by the extinguishing
reaction leads to a dramatic change in the pattern (center versus right).
One of the reasons is that in this model a spontaneous local activation
is not&nbsp; possible since no lateral inhibition is involved (see next
pages). Thus activation has to be triggered locally. In the substrate-removal
version, it takes some time until the pigmentation spreads again (above
left), in contrast to the activator-removal version (middle and right).
Thus, the latter provides a better&nbsp; description of the natural pattern.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the following simulation the situation
at the growing edge is shown in a movie-like manner, at right a space-time
plot is given. It is in part the same simulation as shown above right.
The activator of the modifying oscillation is assumed to remove the activator
of the pigment system:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Even with this simple model, a better survival
at the outer side of the chain of triangles can be achieved. It has its
origin in the lower concentration of the substrate at regions that were
recently activated (lighter green in the simulation below).</font>
