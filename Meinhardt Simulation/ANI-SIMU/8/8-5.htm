<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shells shown above display oblique
branching lines that terminate without any collision with counter-waves.
This termination is not announced by a retardation in the spread of pigmentation,
i.e., by a bending of the lines towards a more perpendicular orientation
in relation to the growing edge. This suggests that the activation is anyway
near the lowest level at which the chain of triggering events can be maintained.
Any additional lowering causes termination even in cells that have not
been activated for a long time. Termination occurs preferentially if two
waves approach each other. Either one or both waves terminate. In the latter
case, a non-activated gap remains. This suggests that a rapidly spreading
inhibition emanates from the activated cells. A counter wave that senses
this inhibition may terminate.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A spontaneous trigger of a new activation
occurs preferentially in the gap left untouched by two terminated waves
(red arrows on shells shown above). This behavior appears counterintuitive.
On one hand, the inhibition is so strong that wave termination takes place
even without collision. On the other hand, a spontaneous activation is
possible somewhat later in the same cells that could not be triggered earlier
by activated neighboring cells.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This suggests that a third, very long-lasting,
non-diffusible inhibition exists that provides a measure for the time passed
since the last activation (blue in the simulation above). A spontaneous
activation becomes possible again only when most of this inhibitor disappeared.
The second diffusible inhibitor (pink in the simulations) is almost completely
gone at this stage. The long lasting inhibitor must be non-diffusible otherwise
the information on the location of the gap would be lost. Therefore, these
two inhibitions have different properties and connot be combined to a single
agend. The long-lasting but local inhibitor also has another function.
Similarly as discussed for
<a href="../5/5-4.htm">penetrating waves</a>,
the local accumulation of this inhibitor also forces pigment activation
to move into a neighboring region even though this region is already poisoned
by the diffusible inhibitor (on its own, a rapidly diffusing inhibitor
would tend to generate spatially stable patterns). The pushing effect of
the non-diffusible inhibitor and the poisoning effect of the diffusible
inhibitor together may be responsible for the situation in which activation
is at the borderline of its maintenance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The simulations below show the termination
of two approaching waves and the triggering of a new wave in the remaining
gap. It appears at the lowest concentration of the long-lasting inhibitor
(blue). The termination results from the long-ranging inhibitor (pink).

for fine structure including branch formation)</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Considering all these features, at least
three inhibitions must be involved to accomplish fine branching lines that
terminate but re-trigger spontaneously in the gaps:</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(i) A very rapid and non-diffusible inhibition
that causes activation to last for a short time interval only (<i>b </i>in
equation, see box; not shown in the graphics). It determines the thickness
of the oblique lines. Its diffusion (if any) must be much smaller than
that of the activator; otherwise no traveling waves would form.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(ii) A rapidly diffusing inhibitor with
a longer time constant whose overall accumulation poisons a region. This
causes wave termination when two waves approach (<i>e </i>in the equation).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(iii) A very long lasting, non-diffusible
inhibition responsible for the shift of activation despite the diffusible
inhibitor (<i>f</i>&nbsp; in the equation). It allows a re-activation only
after a long non-activated time interval. This occurs, therefore,&nbsp;
preferentially in the gaps left open by earlier<a NAME="waves."></a> waves.</font>
