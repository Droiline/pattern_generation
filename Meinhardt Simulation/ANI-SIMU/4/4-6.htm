   <title>Waves from a stable source region</title>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Fishbone-like patterns:
stable source regions of traveling waves</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On some shells, the pigment producing reaction
remain in particular regions in a steady state, while oscillations and
traveling waves take place in the remaining regions.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pattern on <i>Cypraea ziczac </i>suggests
that waves spread from these steady state regions, forming the oblique
lines. As usual, annihilations during collisions lead to the typical V-like
pattern elements.&nbsp; In the animated simulation shown below, the distributions
at the growing edge are shown:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the simulation above, the localized
steady states are obtained by assuming a position-dependent substrate production.
Later this local stabilization will&nbsp; be treated by assuming <a href="../7/7-4.htm">two
each other stabilizing systems</a>, a mode that can be deduced from many
patterns that look overtly very different.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Both in the fishbone-like pattern discussed
on this page and in the <i><a href="4-5.HTM">Voluta musica </a></i>pattern
on the preceding page, stripes perpendicular to the growing edge are a
characteristic feature. However, only in the fishbone pattern shown above
traveling waves are initiated at these stable activations. There, the steady
state is maintained due to the action of the modifying pattern. In contrast,
the stable activations in the <i>musica</i>-type patterns result from a
diffusion-based stabilization. Thus, the permanently activated cells are
surrounded by zones of inhibition, preventing any spread of waves as in
the fishbone pattern.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shell shown below also displays two
narrow stable stripes (a closer inspection revels that these&nbsp; consist
in fact of narrow-spaced dots). In contrast to the fishbone-pattern discussed
above, these stripes seems to have only a limited and indifferent influence
on the oscillating system. Waves can start there, end there or pass through.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
