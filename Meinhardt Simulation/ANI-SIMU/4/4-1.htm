<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pattern on <i>Natica euzona</i> results
from oscillations that have different frequencies along the growing edge.
In some regions, pigment deposition occurs in rapid succession, in others
with longer intervals. Obviously, at least two pattern forming systems
are superimposed. One pattern is essentially stable in time. It is not
visible and becomes evident only due to the space-dependent modulation
of oscillating pigment deposition.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the model it is assumed that the substrate
production (bb in equation 2.4, curve at top right) is not uniform. A higher
production rate leads to a higher oscillation frequency. Therefore, lines
of pigmentation are formed with different spacing. In the transition zone
lines can merge or end blindly.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If initially all cells are in the same
phase, subsequent pigment production will occur earlier in the cells having
a higher substrate production. In the absence of any activator diffusion,
the phase difference between neighboring cells will increase with each
further oscillation until any phase relation is lost. This is especially
obvious if some random fluctuations are assumed as in the figure below
left. Diffusion of the activator has the tendency to synchronize neighboring
cells since cells activated earlier advance their delayed neighbors by
activator exchange (center). Some substrate diffusion is required to obtain
a good correspondence with the natural pattern (right). It enables a slowing
down and <a href="4-2.HTM#antagonist diffusion">merging </a>of waves.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To model the narrower bands in the region
of high oscillation frequencies, the decay rate of the activator (ra) and
the source density s are assumed to have the same spatial pattern as the
substrate production rate bb. The following animated simulation shows the
activity along the growth zone. It is the same as that given above right
as space-time plot:</font>

in the center, the very rapid spread of waves away from the center, the
slowing down and partial merging at lateral positions is easily recognizable.</font>
