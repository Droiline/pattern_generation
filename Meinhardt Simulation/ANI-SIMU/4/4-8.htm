<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shell of <i>Scaphella junonia </i>displays
rows of patches perpendicular to the growing edge. At some regions, new
rows of dots are inserted while at others large patches split into two.
The latter feature suggests that new maxima of a stable patterning systems
become inserted that suppresses pigment formation.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the simulation above, a stable activator
(blue) - inhibitor system is assumed that suppresses the oscillations of
a second system (black). Thus, oscillations can occur only in the space
between the suppressing maxima. If the distance between two maxima of the
suppressing reaction becomes too large, a new&nbsp; maximum can appear
between the two. This leads to the split of row with large patches into
two rows with smaller patches. At least initially the separated patches
maintain synchrony.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Oscillations may only occur if the space
between the suppressing stable maxima is sufficiently large. If it is not,
a relatively broad white stripe results. During growth, the distance between
two inhibiting maxima can become large enough such that oscillation can
set in. A new row of dots becomes established in a region that formed earlier
a larger non-pigmented gap. As shown in the natural pattern above, the
oscillation frequency can be initially lower. Such a small patch may appear
initially in synchrony only with every second normal-sized neighboring
patch.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the animated simulation below, the stable
suppressing pattern is shown in blue, the activator of the oscillating
system in black and its inhibitor in red:</font>
