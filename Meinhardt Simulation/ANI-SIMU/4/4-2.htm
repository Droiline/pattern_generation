   <title>wave termination: blindly ending lines</title>
</head>
<body>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Blindly ending lines:
wave termination</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cells in regions of high substrate supply
act as pacemakers. After a traveling wave enters a region of low substrate
production, the substrate concentration (green) may be too low for the
wave to survive. On the shell this leads to a blindly ending line. The
pattern on <i>Amoria undulata</i> shows this behavior:</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A particular wave will become slower as
it enters a region of lower substrate production but it may find sufficient
substrate to survive. However, due to this reduced speed, the subsequent
wave may terminate since less time is available for the substrate concentration
to recover. Thus, wave termination is expected to occur in regions where
neighboring cells have different oscillation frequencies. As can be seen
from the natural pattern above right, at the position of a terminating
line the subsequent line shows a characteristic irregularity: a deformation
towards the terminated line. In terms of the model this has the following
reason: at positions left untouched by the terminating wave, the substrate
was not consumed for a longer period and the concentration remained at
a higher level. The subsequent wave has therefore more 'fuel to burn'.
In addition, a slight diffusion of the substrate can maintain a low level
of activation until sufficient substrate becomes available again (<a href="#antagonist diffusion">see
below</a>).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following animated simulation shows
the situation along the growing edge. One wave is just able to survive,
the next terminates:</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Wave termination is also clearly visible
in the shell shown below. On this shell, a general gradient exists in the
excitability of the system. It is highest at the left side. Therefore,
the left side act as pace maker and the speed of the waves decline on their
way, resulting in the bent lines. Again, some waves terminate as they enter
a less excitable region. The subsequent lines show the advanced trigger.
The modulation of the background pigmentation indicates the orientation
of the growing edge in the course of time.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Role of&nbsp;<a NAME="antagonist diffusion"></a>antagonist
(substrate) diffusion in the survival of waves</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shell of <i>Natica undulata</i> (below
right) shows thick lines that are occasionally connected by thin lines.
This pattern results from a merging of two waves. The same phenomenon is
visible on the shell of <i><a href="4-1.HTM">Natica euzona</a></i>. This
is non-trivial since usually one wave cannot catch up a preceding wave.
Such a pattern is possible, however,&nbsp; if the antagonist shows a moderate
degree of diffusion. Then,&nbsp; in a situation when otherwise wave termination
would occur, activation can be maintained at a low level due to the surplus
of substrate obtained from the surrounding cells. Very thin and steep lines
are indicative for such a near-arrest of waves without termination. The
substrate diffusion has to be so low that wave formation is not abolished
by lateral inhibition. On some shells only the beginning and the end of
such a line is visible (white arrowheads in the figure below). The renewed
trigger of activation indicates that a low-level activation was there even
if it was insufficient to evoke a visible trace of pigmentation. The simulations
at right show the influence of diffusion. The same initial situation is
assumed; the central figure is without, the right with diffusion. The regions
with a low density of black pixels are regions of low-level activation.</font>
