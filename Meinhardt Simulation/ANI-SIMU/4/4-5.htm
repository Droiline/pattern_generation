   <title>Diffusion-caused coexistence of stable and oscillating patterns</title>

coexistence of oscillating and stable patterns</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pattern <i>Voluta musica</i> is characterized
by two bundles of fine lines perpendicular to the growing edge, interspersed
by lines parallel to the growing edge as well as by isolated patches. This
indicates that oscillating and stable patterns coexist.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The condition for oscillating patterns
are that either the inhibitor molecules have a longer half-life than the
activator molecules or that the rate of substrate production is higher
than the decay rate of the activator molecules. It is easy to see that
a diffusion of either the inhibitor or of the substrate can cause stabilization.
The diffusion of the inhibitor away from a local maximum is equivalent
to a shorter half life. Whether an inhibitor molecule decayed or was removed
by diffusion does not matter for a cell. Thus, diffusion contributes to
the tendency to switch into a stable pattern. Likewise, substrate obtained
from neighboring cells increases the available substrate and thus contributes
also to a transition into a stable state. This, however, this can only
work if a concentration difference exist between adjacent cells otherwise
the same number of molecules would be obtained and lost from neighboring
cells and diffusion would be without effect. Thus, in addition to the diffusion
of the antagonist, a certain phase difference is required between adjacent
cells.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the simulation above left, the diffusion
of the substrate is high&nbsp; enough that some cells enter into a stable
activation, causing the long perpendicular lines. In-between these regions,
the oscillations are still going on. It is clearly visible that the local
transitions into stable activations occur only after the lines obtained
a certain steepness, i.e., after a certain phase difference between cells
accumulated. At right the same simulation is shown in an animated form.</font>
