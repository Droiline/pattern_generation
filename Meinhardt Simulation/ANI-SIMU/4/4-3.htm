saturation of autocatalysis</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pattern on the shell <i>Cypraea diluculum
</i>shows
a mixture of more or less parallel&nbsp; thick lines and very thin steep
lines:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thick lines indicate that the phase of
pigment production is a substantial fraction of the total cycle. This will
occurs if the autocatalysis saturates: If&nbsp; the maximum activator concentration
has an upper bound, the consumption of the available substrate (or the
production of sufficient inhibitor) takes longer. In regions of lower substrate
production, the oscillations frequencies are lower. Consequently, the regions
with the thick lines act as pacemakers. The regions of lower oscillation
frequencies are over-tacted by the regions of high frequencies. These cells
do not reach their fully excitable state since the next trigger occurs
to early. Therefore, the spread of the wave is slow and the lines are steep.
The following simulation shows the situation at the growing edge. Both
right and left marginal sides are regions of high substrate production
(substrate is shown in green):</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Waves trigger only in the region of high
substrate production and spread rapidly within these regions. In contrast,
the activation spreads only slowly in the region of lower substrate production.
The assumption of saturating autocatalysis provides a rationale why thick
parallel and thin steep lines coexists. The saturation leads to a reduced
maximum concentration. Therefore, it takes longer to infect neighboring
cells. On the other hand, since the activation lasts longer, more time
is available to infect the next cell. Therefore, waves terminate only rarely
and a substantial phase difference can accumulate between neighboring regions.
This leads to the steep lines.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pattern on the specimen above provides
strong support for the stipulation that the steep lines result from an
accumulating phase difference. Obviously, a global perturbation took place
for the animal, leading to an interruption of the steep lines on both sides
of the central zone. The pigmentation reappears in that region more or
less simultaneously. Only in the course of time the phase difference will
accumulate again. In the simulation at right, the perturbation is implemented
by assuming a sudden reduction to 10% of the actual activator concentration
in each cell.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation illustrates the
effect of saturation. Without saturation (sa=0 instead of sa=4 in equation
2.4), the differences in the speed of the waves are less extreme; the parallel
lines are much thinner.</font>
