<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The generation of signals by the movement
of molecules via diffusion works only in small fields. In larger fields
the time required to generate patterns by randomly moving molecules would
be much too long. Therefore, the signals generated at small scales have
to be translated into more permanent states of cell differentiation that
can be maintained upon further growth. The obvious means is a stable concentration-
(and thus space-) dependent activation of genes. Mechanisms to generate
graded concentration profiles have been discussed above. On this and the
subsequent page, the concentration-dependent activation of genes will be
illustrated.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The simplest situation is the activation
of a particular gene whenever the local concentration of a signaling molecule
(generally termed a morphogen) exceeds a threshold. This is possible if
a gene product has a positive feedback on the activation of its own gene.
In the following simulation, the signal is shown in green, the level of
gene activation is given in red. The gene activation occurs most rapidly
in the region of highest signal concentration.&nbsp; Below a certain threshold
the cells don't switch even after an indefinitely long time. Thus, although
the gradient is smooth, the resulting gene activation has a sharp border.
This border does not change after the morphogenetic signal is reduced or
disappears. Only the low-level sub-threshold activation (left in the simulation
below) disappears:</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How such a sharp threshold can arise can
be explained on the basis of the equation and the illustration given below:</font>

<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The gene activator <i>a </i>has a positive
feedback on its own synthesis that saturates at high levels. It is cell-
local, i.e., no diffusion takes place as it is appropriate for a transcription
factor; <i>m</i> is the concentration of the external signal, i.e., the
local concentration of the morphogen gradient. With ra = 0.05, sa = 0.02;&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the switch occurs at about&nbsp; m = 0.01</font></td>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">At low levels of the gene activator (below
the yellow spot in the figure below) and in the absence of any external
signal <i>m</i>, the linear decay term is dominating. The concentration
will decrease further (arrow to the left). In contrast, at higher levels
(above the yellow dot) the positive feedback is dominating and the level
will increase until the saturation comes into play. Thus, there are only
two stable states, low and high (pink dots). With an external morphogen,
the curve shifts (red). The low stable steady state may disappear. The
concentration of the gene activator rises until the upper state is reached.
The latter will be maintained even if the morphogen is no longer available:
the cell changed its differentiation permanently.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the animated simulation below it is
assumed that the external signal rises and disappears again. The light
blue bar gives the level of the gene activator in the cell. The abrupt
switch at a particular concentration and the maintenance of the high level
even if the signal has gone is easily seen:</font>
