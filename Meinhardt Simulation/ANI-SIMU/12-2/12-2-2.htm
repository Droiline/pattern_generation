<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>The activation of several
genes under the influence of a morphogen gradient</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Frequently several genes are activated
by a singe morphogen in a space-dependent manner. To find molecularly feasible
mechanisms, the insight was essential that that gene activation and pattern
formation in space share formal features. In spatial pattern formation,
typically cells in a small region become activated, while the remaining
cells at other positions are inhibited. Analogously for gene activation,
imagine that in a particular situation the genes <i>A, B, C </i>or <i>D
</i>can
be activated. To elicit a particular cell differentiation gene <i>C,</i>
for instance, has to become activated and the alternative genes
<i>A, B</i>
and <i>D</i> should be repressed (their activation is required at different
positions). Thus, the selection of a particular gene can be regarded as
a pattern formation among alternative genes. Based on this formal analogy,
gene activation was expected to be based on autoregulation - as the self-enhancement
is usually called in gene activation - and mutual competition. Space-dependent
gene activation results from a coupling between a pattern formation in
space and a pattern formation among alternative genes. By molecular-genetic
observations meanwhile many autoregulatory genes have been found.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Cells become ‘promoted':</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For position-dependent gene activation
under the influence of a graded signal, a particular concentration range
has to lead to the activation of a particular gene. An analysis of experiments
with early insect development has suggested that measuring the concentration
is not a single and instantaneous event, but instead proceeds step by step
until a state is achieved that corresponds to the local morphogen concentration.
An analogy will provide some intuition as to how unidirectional promotion
works:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Let us assume a barrel at the base of a
staircase. A flood can lift it up to a higher level, where it will remain
even when the flood recedes. The position of the barrel is a measure for
the highest level the flood has attained. A higher flood at later times
can lift the barrel to an even higher level. In contrast, a second lower
flood has no influence. The barrel remains where it came to rest before.
Although the flood can vary continuously, the barrel comes to rest only
at very particular level. After a near miss of one level, only the next
lower level is possible.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Starting with a default activation of,
for instance, the gene <i>A</i>, gene <i>B </i>becomes activated in the
region in which the morphogen concentration surpasses a particular threshold
level. In this process, gene <i>A </i>can be switched off due to a mutual
competition. In a still smaller region, gene <i>C </i>will become active,
and so on. Each of these steps is essentially irreversible. The simulation
below shows such stepwise gene activation. Although only small concentration
differences exist in neighboring cells, sharp borders are formed in which
either one or another gene becomes active.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="gene1.gif" height=251 width=248></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The switching from one gene to the next
occurs more rapidly in regions of higher morphogen concentrations. This
leads to a wave-like time course of gene activation as it is observed in
many systems. This is, however, not a real wave based on a sequential triggering
of neighboring cells but cells exposed to a higher morphogen concentration
switch more rapidly. In the simulation below several snapshots are given.
Gene activation is indicated by pixel densities. The movement of the activities
and the sharpening of the borders over time are easily seen.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="gen-xt-p.gif" height=377 width=269></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The actual implementation of the mechanism
has to cope with an apparent paradox. Imagine gene <i>A </i>is the default
gene and that the genes <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>.. should become activated at
higher and higher morphogen concentrations. Gene <i>C</i> requires, therefore,
a higher signal than gene <i>B</i>. Thus, the activation of gene <i>C</i>
is less sensitive in respect to the signal than gene <i>B</i>. Why then
is gene <i>C</i> activated at all? And why it is able to switch off gene
<i>B</i>
that responds more sensitively to the signal? During the modeling it has
turned out that this problem requires quantitative differences in the ability
of the genes for autoregulation: Gene <i>C, </i>although it is less sensitive
to the signal than gene B, can take over since it is more efficient in
its autoregulation. This will occur whenever the signal is high enough.</font>

<td><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All genes involved are assumed to follow
the same rules. Only the equations for the gene product <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
are given as examples. Each gene product a<i>, b, c,..</i> has an autocatalytic
feedback on its own gene and an inhibitory action on the activation of
alternative genes. This has the consequence that within a particular cell
only one of the alternative genes can remain active. The self-inhibition
of a gene has the character of a saturation and leads to an upper limit
of the activation that a gene can obtain. The morphogen
<i>m
</i>has an
additional activating influence on the genes. In this example it is assumed
that the activation of the gene b requires the presence of the gene product
of the gene a. sa, sb, sc... are the coupling constants for the self-amplification.
For a position-dependent gene activation it is required that 'higher' genes
are less sensitive to the morphogen but better in the mutual competition,
i.e., the relation sc>sb>sa must be satisfied ra, rb...= 0.01, sa = 1;
sb = 1.42; sc = 2,..</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The biological significance of this unidirectional
promotion is easy to understand. If a graded distribution is generated
by a local source in conjunction with diffusion, any growth enlarges the
distance between a given cell and the source. The morphogen concentration
will generally decrease in the course of time. And yet, if activated genes
remain activated upon a lowering of the morphogen concentration, an existing
subdivision will be maintained even in the face of growth or stretching
of the tissue domain: After the interpretation is complete, the signal
is no longer necessary and can be turned off. Several biological systems
are known that show this type of regulation (references are in the book).
The simulation below shows three snapshots of a gene system as described
above in a uniformly growing tissue. The space-dependent activation of
particular genes is controlled by the inhibitor (red) of an activator-inhibitor
system. In the center (marked by arrows) the signal becomes lower and lower.
Nevertheless, the regions of different gene activities are maintained (the
trigger of a new activator maximum is suppressed by a small baseline inhibitor
production).</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also clearly visible in this simulation
is that as long as the signal is about to promote the transition, a cross-activation
with the next ‘higher’ gene exists (upper figure). This cross-activation
disappears when the signal becomes anyway too low to accomplish the next
transition.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Two types of regulatory behavior reported
in the literature are described by the model in a straightforward manner.
First, an increase in the morphogen concentration after the final determination
is already obtained leads to a distal or posterior transformation. In contrast,
as mentioned above, a lowering remains without effect. Experimentally realized
are such changes in the morphogen concentration by transplantations either
towards or away from the source or by implantation of morphogen-releasing
tissue. The following simulation shows first a steady state after the promotion
is completed. After an increase in the signal all structures shift according
to the new concentrations. In contrast, no shift occurs after removal of
the signal:</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation shows the behavior
if the signal is prematurely removed. The gene normally activated last
and at the highest concentration (brown) in the step-wise promotion is
not reached:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="ge-nuik.gif" height=238 width=235></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A biological example for that behavior
can be found in Nieuwkoop's experiment with early amphibian embryos. In
<i>Xenopus </i>he removed organizing regions very early and found less
posterior structures. He concluded, that posterior transformation depends
on the duration that the organizing tissue is in contact with the tissue
to be specified. In terms of the model, time plays a role, but the promotion
comes to rest at a concentration-specific level that is not exceed even
when the cells are exposed to the transforming signal for an extended period.</font>
