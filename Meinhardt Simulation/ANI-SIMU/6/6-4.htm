<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although many features are correctly reproduced,
several problems still remain. On the shell shown below, for instance,
a transition into a steady state occurs that shows modulations parallel
to the growing edge. In the model, transitions into a steady state with
horizontal modulations also occur (<a href="6-1.htm#triangles with horizontal">for
equation and constants click here</a>). However, from the model it would
be expected that the modulation becomes more pronounced shortly before
the transition from the steady state into pulse-like activation occurs,
in contrast to the natural patterns. The reason for the expectation is
as follows: during triangle formation the hormone concentration increases
due to the growing number of pigment-producing cells. This leads to a gradual
change from the stable steady state towards the oscillatory mode. As shown
in the simulation at right, it is expected that the horizontal modulation
becomes strongest shortly before the large-scale breakdown occurs. In contrast,
in the natural pattern this transition occurs abrupt and without any announcement.</font>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Further, in the simulations global transitions
occur from the normal pattern towards dense oblique lines that don't branch.
After some time, the system return to normal pattern formation. The reason
for these global transitions is unclear. Long oblique lines with relatively
little branching is visible on the shell in the center. In the shell at
left, a particular region seems to maintain a steady state&nbsp; (perpendicular
line) from which waves move to both sides. A similar phenomenon can be
seen in the simulation.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many <i>Oliva </i>shells show a similar
but seemingly independent pattern in the background. It is unclear whether
this patterning results from an independent system or from a sequential
patterning that uses the same system.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The background pattern is also clearly
visible on&nbsp; the following&nbsp; shell. This shell also demonstrates,
very convincingly, that branch formation is globally controlled. Once a
high density of waves is achieved, branch formation becomes unlikely and
most waves terminate simultaneously upon collision.</font>
