<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The simulations reproduce many details
of the natural pattern. The mechanisms were designed to satisfy the simultaneous
branch initiation. The high probability of simultaneous initiation leads
to many V-like elements with the same distance between the tip of the V
and the points of branch initiation:</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many branches appear only loosely connected
with the oblique line. Sometimes a small hook appears close to the point
of branch initiation:</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This indicates that the original wave proceeds
undisturbed. In contrast, between the primary activation and the activation
of the backwards- running wave a temporary depression can exist. In the
model, this effect results from an overshoot during the normal chain of
triggering events, which leads to concentrations much higher than the temporary
steady state. Moreover, most of the pulse-like activation may already be
over when the transition towards the temporary steady state occurs. Thus,
the local re-activation can occur after some delay, leading to a small
gap between the primary oblique line and the branch. The small hooks result
from incipient waves initiated parallel to the primary wave. Frequently
these waves don't survive since the cells are not yet sufficiently excitable.
However,<b> </b>if this wave does survive a parallel line close to the
original line is formed:</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Very dense local branching can occur. In
the model this occurs if by chance many waves become extinct almost simultaneously.
A low density of waves in some parts along the growing edge causes an increase
in branching in the remaining parts. Branching can occur in rapid succession.</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The model outlined so far does not allow
the spontaneous trigger of new waves. However, the spontaneous initiation
of pairs of pigment lines after long non-activated periods indicate that
this occurs in reality. This requires that an inhibitor drop to very low
levels such that a new activation can be triggered from a basic activator
level. However, the fact that the waves don't change the speed or the level
of activation even after a long non-activated period clearly indicates
that this cannot result from the same inhibitor that is employed so far
for switching off the activation. Thus, a second inhibitor must exist that
has a long time constant. In the simulation shown below, this inhibitor
has also a longer range. With this addition, the pattern can be generated
from an initially uniform situation. The existence of two antagonistic
reactions has been also deduced from completely different shell patterns

The additional inhibitor is shown in pink. The spontaneous initiation of
new waves in regionS were this inhibitor is low is clearly visible.</font>
