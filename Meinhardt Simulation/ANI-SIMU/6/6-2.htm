<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One will never find two shells of <i>Oliva
porphyria </i>with exactly the same pattern. According to the model, minor
differences are decisive whether the branch formation actually occurs or
not. If a branch was formed the probabilities for further branching changes
– a characteristic feature of chaotic processes. Therefore, unavoidable
minor differences are sufficient to generate a diversity of patterns. In
the following two figures, two simulations, black and red, are superimposed
that are initiated with the same initial conditions. Only a different set
of random numbers is used. Initially, both patterns are identical with
the red pattern covering the black pattern almost completely. With each
decision to form or not to form a branch, the patterns become more different
and the differences spread to neighbouring regions. In the left simulations,
<u>+</u>1% fluctuations have been assumed in the autocatalysis, in the
right simulation <u>+</u>10%. As expected, in the latter case the pattern
diversifies more rapidly.</font>
