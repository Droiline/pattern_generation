control</font></font></center>

<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several patterns suggest that global control
mechanisms play a role. In the shell shown below, termination of pigment
production occurs simultaneously at very distant positions.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On other shells, this global control is
more hidden. The shell of <i>Oliva porphyria </i>shows oblique lines with
branching. A branch along an oblique line indicates the sudden formation
of a backward wave. As shown in the enlargement, at a particular moment
many backwards-running waves are initiated simultaneously at distant locations.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For traveling waves in excitable media
the sudden formation of backward waves is a very unusual event. The new
waves must spread into a region that should be refractory due to the primary
wave. Therefore, a spontaneously formed backwards running wave should never
occur.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As mentioned above, normal traveling waves
in excitable media annihilate each other upon a collision. This would lead
to a continuos decline of the number of traveling waves until no wave is
left. (below left). Branch formation leads to a doubling of the number
of traveling waves. Thus, the initiation of backwards running waves would
be one way to maintain the number of traveling waves. In this view, they
are expected to be initiated whenever the number of waves becomes too low
. For this, a hormone-like substance is proposed that circulates rapidly
within the animal (green in the simulation below). All pigment-producing
cells contribute to the hormone production. In this way a global signal
is available throughout the animal that provides information about how
many waves exist within the mantle gland and the growing edge.</font>

<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To initiate a backwards-running wave, cells
have to remain in a steady state until the refractory period of the neighboring
cells is over.&nbsp; Whether a pulse-like or steady state activation occurs
depends on the <a href="../3/32.htm">ratio of time constants</a>. A shortening
of the half-life of the inhibitor can lead to the required transition from
the pulse-like into the steady state activation. Therefore, the hormone
is assumed to stabilizes the inhibitor. Each activated cell produces the
hormone. Whenever the number of traveling waves and thus the hormone concentration
become too low (light green phase in the simulation above),&nbsp; the inhibitor
will decay so rapidly that the cells switch from the pulse-like mode into
a continuos mode of activation. The neighboring cells can be re-infected
after their refractory period is over. This leads to branch initiation
and a&nbsp; doubling of the number of traveling waves. Thus, the hormone
concentration rises rapidly and the cells return to normal pulse-like activation
that propagates in a wave-like manner (dark-green period). The following
movie shows very clearly the trigger of backwards running waves whenever
the hormone concentration (green) becomes too low:</font>
