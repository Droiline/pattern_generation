of enhancement and suppression –</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>one ore two modifying reactions?</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As mentioned above, many of these shell
patterns suggest a simultaneous involvement of an enhancing and an extinguishing
modification. For example, the perpendicular dark lines on <i>Conus episcopus
</i>shown
below arguing for an enhancement, and the white droplet-like patterns along
these dark lines arguing for a destabilization under the enhancing influence.
The large-scale breakdowns of pigmentation suggest a rapid spread of an
extinguishing reaction while the existence of branch formation along narrow
lines suggest that the pigmentation reaction changes&nbsp; from time to
time from a wave-like spread into a temporary steady state that allows
the trigger of backward waves. Interestingly on the shell below are also
unsuccessful attempts to initiate a backwards wave, leading to small triangles
attached to the oblique lines. A satisfying coherent explanation is still
missing.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course, one could imagine that both
an enhancing and an extinguishing reaction are superimposed. An example
is given in the simulation below. In the dark region the even the darker
lines result from the enhancing reaction (green). In the regions that are
not in the steady state, this leads to branch formation. In turn, the enhanced
pigment reaction leads more rapidly to the trigger of the extinguishing
reaction (red), causing the preferential dropouts of the pigmentation along
the dark lines. The finer dark lines are simulated by an extinguishing
reaction that follows the pigmentation reaction in a wave-like manner.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The preferential formation of white regions
in the center of the shell is simulated by an increased production rate
of the substrate for the&nbsp; extinguishing reaction (plotted at the top
of the simulation). Although this simulation requires the interaction of
6 substances, the similarity between the natural and the simulated pattern
is not overwhelming. The two shells below provide other examples of this
type of patterns.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The simulation below is an attempt to combine
enhancement and extinguishing reaction. An analogy to doping in sport was
used to illustrate the basic idea. Doping releases the available resources
of the body, enabling temporarily a higher output of power. This, however,
can cause a breakdown when resources become exhausted. Without doping,
a continuous output of power is possible over a longer period, although
at a lower level. With doping, more resources are removed than can be replenished.
Therefore, exhaustion comes into effect only if the system is without doping
at the border where a continuous activation is just possible. In contrast,
if the ability to replenish resources is sufficiently high, no enhancement-induced
breakdown will take place. In the simulation below, the breakdown is initiated
in the regions of the darker lines as required for the pattern on <i>Conus
pennaceus</i>. Again, the match between the natural and the simulated pattern
is limited. A more appropriate interaction waits to be discovered.</font></div>
