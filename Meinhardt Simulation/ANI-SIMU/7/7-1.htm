<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Generation of complex patterns
by the superposition of several pattern forming systems</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many shells show patterns far more complex
than those simulated so far. In chapter 4 patterns were discussed that
result from the modification of the pigment-producing system by a second,
not directly visible pattern. In these cases, the modifying pattern was
stable. This is, however, only a special case since a change in a single
time constant can be sufficient to switch from a stable into an oscillating
mode. Therefore, it is assumed that the complex patterns described in this
and the following two chapters result from a pigment producing system that
is modified by one or more time-dependent, usually invisible, patterns.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although a huge diversity of patterns exists,
a closer inspection reveals that the patterns share many common elements.
In the following series, each subsequent shell pattern has common elements
with the preceding one but also displays new features:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><i>Conus marmoreus</i> (above left) shows
white drop-like regions on a dark pigmented background. In <i>Conus marchionatus</i>
the white drops are enlarged at the expense of the pigmented regions. The
pattern is reminiscent of staggered wine glasses. <i>Conus pennaceus</i>
shows, in addition, regions with a coherent background pigmentation that
is structured by dark perpendicular lines that are occasionally interrupted
by small white drops.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In <i>Conus auratus</i> (above left), the
dark lines are maintained without the white drops.&nbsp; Instead, a periodic
large-scale transition to oblique lines with crossings occurs. Shortly
before such a transition occurs, the continuous background becomes modulated
parallel to the growing edge (arrow). Such axially oriented parallel lines
on top of a pigmented background are a characteristic pattern element on
<i>Conus
textile. </i>Non-pigmented regions with a drop-like shape occasionally
appear. Their lower borders are formed by dark pigmented lines. In regions
without pigmented background the pattern displays fine lines with a mesh-like
arrangement as mentioned above. Similar parallel lines with occasional
loops (tongues) are characteristic for <i>Clithon </i>or <i>Neritina oualaniensis</i>
(right). Here, however, the regions with fine lines are missing.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the specimen of <i>Clithon </i>above
left the narrow spaced parallel lines are framed by oblique lines, causing
the overall impression of connected triangles. This pattern is also characteristic
of the bivalved mussel <i>Lioconcha castrensis. </i>Similarly, in the shell
of the snail <i>Voluta vespertilio </i>oblique lines and triangles result
from very fine parallel lines. The larger triangles that occasionally form
may become the starting points for branches.</font>
