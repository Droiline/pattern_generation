the pigmentation reaction</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the shell shown below, in addition to
the white drop-like pattern elements, regions with coherent background
pigmentation are visible that show darker lines perpendicular to the growing
edge. This indicates the formation of an additional stable pattern. However,
small white drops&nbsp; interrupt the dark lines. This suggests that the
elevated pigment production leads to the preferential breakdown of the
pigment production. This interplay of amplification and breakdown is the
central issue of this chapter (and still an <a href="7-7.htm">open problem</a>).</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stable perpendicular stripes will occur
if a second stable pattern forming system exists that, for example, locally
increases the substrate production for the pigmentation reaction. In the
upper part of the following simulation, the stable pattern is shown green.
In the lower part, only the enhanced pigmentation is shown.</font>

<p><img SRC="7-xtsenk.gif" height=298 width=326></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thus, the assumption is that an additional
pattern exists that stabilizes the pigment pattern. It depends on the pigmentation
reaction. In the case of the perpendicular stripes shown above, both pattern
are stable. On this and the subsequent pages it is shown that such a reaction
can generate in other ranges of parameters a surprising diversity of patterns
that have their counterparts on the real shells.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On <i>Conus pennaceus BORN,</i> branches
are the dominating pattern elements. Branching will occur it the trigger
of the enhancing pattern (green in the simulation further below) shifts
the system from a pulse-like to a steady state activation. Cells remain
activated sufficiently long. If the refractory period of adjacent cells
is over backwards waves can be triggered.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation shows this&nbsp;<a NAME="branch"></a>branch
formation in more detail. The enhancing and elongating pattern is shown
in green. The movie on the right shows the same simulation as upper half
of the space-time plot on the left:</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other details point again to the extinguishing
component. Abrupt wave termination occurs at the beginning of large non-pigmented
patches. Moreover, areas with dark background patterns exist that display
also the even darker perpendicular lines. These are interrupted by the
white drops mentioned above:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The figure below shows another region of
the same shell given at the top of this page. It displays a remarkable
feature for which no satisfactory model is yet available. The 'staggered
wine glass pattern' result from waves that move toward each other with
increasing velocity. However, instead of annihilating each other, they
give rise to a local activation that remains stable for a certain time,
forming the 'stem' of the wine glass pattern. Later, this activation broadens,
split and start to move to both sides, giving rise to the next accelerating
waves.</font>
