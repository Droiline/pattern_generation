extinguishes the pigmentation reaction</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The white drop-like pattern on <i>Conus
marmoreus </i>results from a relatively slow spread of pigmentation while
a termination of pigment deposition occurs almost simultaneously over a
large region. It is, so to speak, a collective breakdown. In this photograph,
the regions at the growing edge in which pigment were produced at the end
of life of the animal is clearly visible.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to the model a bistable pigment-producing
system (black) exists. The activated state spreads slowly by infection.
After a certain time delay the pigment reaction triggers a second and much
faster spreading reaction (red, invisible on the shell) that extinguishes
the pigmentation reaction. The animated simulation and the space-time plot
below show the same simulation. The extinguishing pattern is assumed to
degrade the activator more rapidly. Therefore, it shifts the system from
a steady state mode into an oscillating mode. The activation of the pigment-producing
system is maintained at the margins of a pigmented region since there the
substrate concentration is sufficiently high. After the short extinguishing
reaction is over, the spread of pigmentation and its maintenance in recently
activated regions continues. Thus, the pattern results from a permanent
change between a slowly&nbsp; spreading steady state and a rapid large-scale
extinguishing with survival of the activation at front of the spreading
pigment reaction:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a related species, the extinguishing
reaction is obviously stronger. This leads in many cases to a termination
of the pigmentation. Those sites that were recently activated have a lower
chance of&nbsp; survival – a feature that we will meet again with oblique
chains of&nbsp; <a href="../8/8-1.htm">triangles</a>.</font>

<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shell shown below shows a modulation
of the pigmentation. The regions of high pigmentation consist in fact of
densely packed horizontal lines. Either the steady state of the pigment
reaction is close to a transition into an oscillating mode. Alternatively,
as shown below right, if the extinguishing reaction occurs more frequently
but is less effective, the pigment system frequently escapes from down-regulation.
The rapid spread of the extinguishing reaction leads to a partial synchronization
of the extinguishing reaction. The result is a modulation of the pigmented
region by parallel lines.</font>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There is a non-trivial discrepancy between
the natural pattern and the simulations. The "white drops" have relative
sharp tips in the simulations while they are more rounded in the natural
pattern (see also the first shell on this page). Such a rounding indicates
that the waves accelerate shortly before they collide. This discrepancy
is clearly visible in the following figure:</font>
