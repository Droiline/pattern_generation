annihilation: Crossing of oblique lines</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A mentioned earlier, usually <a href="../3/34.HTM">two
colliding waves annihilate each other</a>,&nbsp; leading to the V-shaped
patterns on the shell. Some shells show, however, crossing lines:</font>

<p><img SRC="57rn.jpg" height=300 width=296><img SRC="57rta.jpg" height=301 width=276></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Crossings of oblique lines testify that
in these cases waves can penetrate each other without annihilation - a
very unusual behavior of waves in excitable media. It is a property of
the one activator-two antagonist mechanism to generate this pattern:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="57-el-m2.gif" height=95 width=188></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the simulation above, an activator-substrate
model is assumed that is tuned to bistability. High activation spreads
due to activator diffusion. The high state is reached with some overshoot.
The additional diffusible inhibitor (red) causes each subsequently activated
cell to down regulate the activation in previously activated cells. Apparently
normal traveling waves result. However, at the point of collision the activation
survives due to the rapid decrease of the additional inhibitor. After recovery
of the substrate (green), two new waves are initiated. In the time record,
this leads to the crossings:</font>

<div class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a feature of such a system that the
borders reflect the waves. Since the borders are assumed to be impermeable,
they act like a mirror, i.e., as if a virtual wave approaches the border
from the other side of the border. This satisfies the condition that no
loss or gain takes place across the borders. This mirror-like reflection
of the waves is clearly visible in the simulation shown above.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation shows a similar situation
in a larger field with different initialization.</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The model accounts for regulatory features
that can be deduced from the shell of <i>Tapes literatus </i>shown below.
The pattern&nbsp; displays a global irregularity. Many waves vanished at
the same time. Other waves survived and even formed new waves by wave splitting.
The model resolves this apparently contradictory behavior between the extinction
of waves on the one hand and the simultaneous generation of new waves on
the other. According to the model,&nbsp; temporary lowering of the activator
can lead either to wave termination or, due to the concomitant reduction
of inhibitor concentration, to the initialization of a new pair of waves,
as occurring during a&nbsp; collision. In some cases, the attempt to form
two waves is clearly visible but one wave did not survive due to the mutual
competition.</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although, as a rule, both waves survive
a collision, in some instances one of the new waves becomes extinct, causing
a pattern like an amputated X (figures below left).&nbsp; Again, this provides
strong support for the involvement of lateral inhibition in this type of
wave formation. Immediately after wave penetration, the two waves still
exert an inhibitory influence onto each other.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Since the system can temporary remain in
a steady state (as occuring during wave penetration), the system is also
able to generate spontaneous backwards-running waves and thus braching
lines. With somewhat different parameters (see box) the tendency to form
branches increases. The simulation below right shows amputated X's and
branching:</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shells below also show a global perturbation.
The traveling waves terminate but new waves are initiated that spread to
both sides. On the right shell, some pigment deposition was maintained
during the perturbation. It is clearly visible that this occurred at the
front side of the wave.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="per-54.jpg" height=243 width=398></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is also reproduced in the simulation.
The activation is highest at the wave front. Therefore, during a global
reduction of the activation, the chance is there the highest that some
activation survives. Both simulations below use the same initial situation
and differ only in the degree of activator reduction during the perturbation,
to 15% at left and 10% at right:</font>

<p><img SRC="per2-xt.gif" height=176 width=184><img SRC="per1-xt.gif" height=177 width=185></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The right simulation is shown below in
a movie-like manner. After the perturbation, the inhibitor (red) decays
so rapidly that the re-established activation triggers waves that spread
to both sides. Some of the resulting waves subsequently annihilate each
other (as can be seen in the left shell shown above). After some time,
a preferential orientation of waves may be re-established.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="per-pm.gif" height=110 width=250></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In these simulations, no asymmetry over
the field is assumed. In the real situation, the side attached to the older
shell part (left in the photographs above) act certainly as a pacemaker
by having a higher oscillation frequency. This leads to a predictable orientation
of the waves. The bending of the oblique lines result from a systematic
retardation as the cells enter regions that are less and less excitable.</font>
