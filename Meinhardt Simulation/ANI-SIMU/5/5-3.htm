chessboard-like patterns</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the preceding considerations the long-lasting
and locally acting antagonist has been assumed to destabilize a stable
pattern. One can argue also other way around: the long-lasting antagonist
on its own would lead to a <a href="../3/31.htm">oscillation</a> and the
additional long-ranging antagonist enforces a de-synchronization. If some
cells are a bit delayed in an array of cells oscillating in near-synchrony,
this phase difference will increase further due to the inhibitory influence
that spreads from the advanced neighbors. It delays the somewhat retarded
cells even more. The synchronism breaks down and oscillations out of phase
are formed. The resulting pattern is close to a chessboard with its periodicity
along both axes.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the simulation above, again the activator-substrate-inhibitor
system equation 5.1 has been used. Different is that the production rate
of the diffusible substrate (green) is insufficient to maintain a stable
pattern. Thus, both antagonists enforce an oscillating pattern.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="56-cb-m.gif" height=114 width=328></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The broadness of the peaks depends on saturation.
Without saturation, the peaks would be more confined in space and time,
leading to more isolated maxima, a pattern that also exists (see also <a href="5-5.html">oblique
rows of dots</a>).</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As can bee seen on the first shell shown
on this page, the chessboard pattern is prone to change into a pattern
of oblique lines. In the model, this occurs if the high activation shifts
into a neighboring position without a preceding breakdown. This happens,
for instance, after an increase in the substrate production&nbsp; (bb from
0.003 to 0.004). This leads to traveling waves and thus to oblique lines
on the shell.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="56-tw.gif" height=233 width=157></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On some shells either the initiation or
the extinction of&nbsp; waves occurs out of phase. According to the model,
this is caused by the lateral inhibition inherent in this mode of wave
formation. The resulting patterns seem to display a discontinuity. The
simulation below shows that the model reproduces this phenomenon. Such
a 'discontinuity' can be stable over an extended period.</font>
