<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many shells display simple patterns that
require the combined action of two antagonists. Oblique lines that cross
each other, net-like patterns, chains of dots arranged along oblique lines
and chessboard-like&nbsp; patterns belong to this group.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These patterns are explicable under the
assumption that two antagonists are at work: one that is responsible for
the pattern in space, the other for the pattern in time. Therefore, one
antagonist must have a long range and a short time constant as required
for the generation of stable spatial patterns. In contrast, the other must
have a long time constant but a short range to generate a pattern in time.
Due to their combined action, the local activation maxima become unstable.
Either they disappear and reappear at displaced positions (oblique row
of dots) or they are permanently shifted into a neighboring position (oblique
lines). Each of these antagonistic reactions can be based on an inhibitor,
produced at the activated region, or from a substrate, produced everywhere
and that is consumed during activation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the following simulations first a pattern
is formed by an <a href="../2/2-5.htm">activator-substrate system</a> (black-green)
as explained in chapter 2. Due the slow increase of a concomitantly produced
inhibitor (red) that diffuse only very little (or not at all), the autocatalysis
is locally down regulated. The maxima start to move since sufficient substrate
is still available in a neighboring region, :</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the time record, the following pattern
would result. The right figure shows how the pattern would look like without
the action of the additional inhibitor: stable stripes are formed.</font>
