in space and time consists of rows of staggered dots:</font>

<p><img SRC="kays-dia.jpg" height=149 width=250></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Activation in discrete patches suggests
that both antagonists diffuse. This can lead to patch-like activations
that are separated along the space-&nbsp; <i>and </i>along time-coordinate.
This pattern occurs in a wide range of parameters if both antagonists are
inhibitors (<a NAME="Equation 5.3"></a>Equation 5.3 of the book).</font>
<center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is clearly visible that after the trigger
of an activation (black), one of the inhibitors (red) spreads rapidly.
The other (green) spreads only slowly but remains for a longer period.
New activations are possible only when the concentrations of both inhibitors
become low enough (white regions).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As mentioned, in the activator-inhibitor
scheme new maxima are inserted preferentially at some distance from existing
activated regions (see <a href="../2/2-2.HTM">insertion of maxima during
growth</a>). This is what happens in the staggered dot patterns, except
that the influence of existing maxima don' t fade away due to increasing
distances but since they disappear after a short time interval due to the
accumulation of the long-lasting inhibitor. With a moderate diffusion rate
of the long-lasting inhibitor, traveling waves are no longer possible.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the animated simulation shown below
it is clearly visible that the new peaks appear at one side of the former
peaks. There the long lasting inhibition (green) is the lowest. After each
new activation, the minimum becomes displaced to the left:</font>
<center><img SRC="5-stag-d.gif" height=145 width=248></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With the increase of the diffusion of the
long lasting inhibitor, the new maxima appear at larger and larger distances
from the preceding maxima. However, the maximum cannot be shifted into
a region exposed to the inhibitor of the neighboring peak. Thus, the maxima
appear&nbsp;<a NAME="precisely"></a>precisely&nbsp; between the activations
of the preceding row (below right).</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In this equation, the second antagonist

concentration remains in a wide range independent of <i>c. </i>This destabilization

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This mechanism&nbsp; - the destabilization
of established maxima - will play a major role also the discussion of other
basic biological processes, for instance in <a href="../12-4/12-4-1.htm">phyllotaxis</a>
and in the <a href="../12-3/12-3-2.htm">orientation of chemotactic cells
and growth cones</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In E.coli the selection of a new division
site is based on a similar process.&nbsp; High concentrations of an inhibitor
of new division sites jump from one pole to the other and back, leaving
only the center as a new division site. For this reaction, many molecular
details are known. The corresponding model describe the observations in
fine details, see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/25/14202/DC1">http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/25/14202/DC1</a></font></div>
