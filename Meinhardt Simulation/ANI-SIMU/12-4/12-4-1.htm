leaves along spirals</font></font></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The regular initiation of new leaf primordia
behind the tip of a growing shoot, the so-called phyllotaxis, seems to
have nothing in common with any pattern on seashells. This impression is,
however, misleading. On growing shoots as in shells, the new pattern elements
are initiated in a narrow zone. The tip of the shoot, the meristem, contains
undifferentiated cells that divide rapidly. Only cells just leaving this
zone are able to generate new leaf primordia. Thus, the leaf-forming zone
has the geometry of a narrow ring. As in shells, the final pattern of leaves
or seedlings is a time record of what happens in the primordia-forming
zone.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many flowering plants display helical patterns.
The same holds for the arrangement of seedlings. The fir cone shown below
is an example. A comparison shows that in both systems the new elements
- seedling or pigment spots - appear at regularly displaced positions.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="Phylshel.gif" BORDER=0 height=179 width=395></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As it has been shown above, <a href="../5/5-5.htm">signals
can emerge at regular displaced positions</a> if two antagonists are involved.
In the simulation below, two inhibitors are assumed. One spreads rapidly
and keeps the signal localized (red). The second one (green) has a longer
time constant and spreads much less widely. It allows the formation of
a further signal in the same region only after a certain time interval.
Both effects together enforce the new signals to emerge at regularly shifted
positions. As it is appropriate for phyllotaxis, in the simulation below,
the time is plotted bottom-up, in contrast to the simulations of shell
patterns.</font>

<p><img SRC="kai-sim.gif" BORDER=1 height=466 width=375>
<br>(for equation and parameters <a href="../5/5-5.htm#Equation 5.3">click
here</a>; time is plotted bottom-up)</center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In plants, the displacement between subsequent
leaves is frequently close to 137.5&deg;, the golden angle. This helical
arrangement requires that the positioning of a new leaf is not only influenced
by the last but also by the earlier leaves. This is easily understandable.
Imagine that a first leaf exists. The second can appear at 180&deg;. Only
if the third leaf to be formed is exposed to some inhibitory influence
from the first, it cannot be formed at the same circumferential position
as the first and will become displaced. As discussed above for the shell
patterns, this requires two antagonists with different properties. According
to this model, the helical arrangement does not result from an inhibitory
influence of the earlier leaves directly, but from the remnants of the
long-lasting antagonist in the leaf-forming zone that a preceding leaf
has left behind at this position.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the diameter of the ring-shaped zone
next to the meristem is small, there is space only for one maximum at the
time. The simulation below shows the situation in the ring. The long-lasting
inhibition is shown in green. A new activation arises always at a position
where green is lowest. Although the simulation is initiated by random fluctuations
only, the helical positioning is rapidly attained. The figure at right
illustrates the helical arrangement if these rings are piled up to a cylinder.
Signals at the rear of the cylinder are drawn in gray to allow a better
3-D visualization.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recent observations have shown that the
plant hormone auxin is required as a prerequisite in leaf initiation (Reinhardt
et al., 2000; Plant Cell 12, 507-518). Suppression of auxin transport suppresses
leaf initiation, a situation that can be rescued by a local supply of auxin.
This suggests that one of the expected antagonistic reactions results from
a depletion of auxin in a wider surrounding. The figure below shows snapshots
of a corresponding simulation. Auxin is shown in gray, the long lasting
inhibition in red. The upper row shows the coming and going of a signal
to initiate a primordium. A new primordium appears when auxin concentration
is high enough and the inhibitor low enough. The primordium remains localized
due to a depletion of auxin in a wider region. The blue arrow points to
the site of the least concentration of the long-lasting inhibitor, foreshadowing
the position where the next leaf primordia will arise.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The bottom row shows the initiation of
the two subsequent primordia at displaced positions. In the simulation
it is assumed that the spread of auxin is accomplished by diffusion. A
more realistic model has to include its active transport.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The displacement by the golden angle is
a stable configuration attained in a wider range of parameters and interactions.
The simulation below is based on the same interaction as used above. As
used in many botanical textbooks, the position of the activated regions
are plotted on circles with shrinking radius, the most recent primordia
are close to the center. The angle drawn has 137,5&deg;. As the simulation
shows, the angular separation of two successive primordia is close to the
golden angle.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The notion of 137.5&deg; may suggest a
very high precision. However, as shown in the two figures at right, the
natural patterns also show some variation.</font>

shell patterns is able to generate a helical pattern with the following
set of constants</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Also common are patterns in which new leaves
either appear at alternating opposing positions (distichous patterns) or
in a pair-wise arrangement in which each subsequent pair is rotated by
90&deg; (decussate pattern). The generation of paired peaks has been discussed
already above in connection with the <a href="../12-3/12-3-3.htm#opposite">non-random
patterning of isolated chemotactic cells</a>. They occur if the size of
the leaf-forming zone is sufficiently large such that two peak can be formed
simultaneously and if the diffusion of the long-lasting antagonist is high
enough such that the new maxima appear <a href="../5/5-5.htm#precisely">precisely
in the gaps</a> of the previous maxima:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="r-82-pa.gif" height=323 width=161><img SRC="Phyl-cr.gif" BORDER=0 height=197 width=203></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although the alternating pattern can be generated
by a system with a <a href="../2/2-7.htm#phyllotaxis">single inhibitor</a>,
minor changes (see box) allow the generation of alternating peaks with
the two-antagonist model:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whether auxin is involved as a long-ranging
signal is an open question. From the modeling, the use of a real inhibitor
as antagonist (as used in the simulations at the top of this page, Eq.
5.4) leads in the modeling usually to more robust patterning. This has
its origin from the tendency of maxima generated by a depletion mechanism
to broaden and to split.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to this model, the spacing between
leaves depends not only on the inhibition of the already established leaf
primordia on the initiation of the next. Proposed is that two different
inhibitions are involved: one around the circumference and one that determines
when new primordia can be formed again. The necessity of such a separation
is especially evident in plants with a whorl-like arrangement of leaves
that are separated by leaf-free zones:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="whorl.jpg" height=316 width=251></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are certainly other elements that
have to be included in future models, such as the real geometry of the
dome-shaped tip of the shoot, the rapid differentiation of the upper and
lower leaf surface and the feedback of leaf primordia onto the meristem.</font>
