<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During development many structures emerge
close to each other. Two different mechanisms are conceivable. Either the
organizer is the source region of a substance that acts as morphogen, causing
the
<a href="../12-2/12-2-2.htm">activation of particular genes
</a>in
certain concentration ranges and thus in a position-specific manner. Alternatively,
the pattern forming system that gives rise to the organizer induces on
longer range a second patterning system. Locally however, this second system
is suppressed by the first. Then, the second system has to appear in the
neighborhood of the first. In Hydra, at a certain distance from the opening
of the gastric column, at the border of the so-called hypostome, ca. 5-6
tentacles appear. Tentacle formation is certainly based on a separate pattern
forming system, otherwise only a ring-shaped structure but not separate
elements along this ring-shaped zone would be formed.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="r-hy-ok.jpg" height=169 width=250></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the spacing of the tentacles is governed
by a scheme involving lateral inhibition, why only a single ring of tentacles
is formed? Many experiments can be accounted for by the assumption that
tentacles are under control of a tentacle-specific activator-inhibitor
system that depends on a high source density (competence). Since the primary
head system causes an increase in the source density in a wider area, the
head system generates the precondition for tentacle initiation. Locally,
however, the head signal suppresses tentacle formation. Therefore, tentacle
formation (red) occurs next to the head. In contrast to the head system,
the tentacle system has no influence on the competence. Since the competence
for tentacle formation is highest in the region next to the hypostome,
the tentacles are able to suppress the formation other tentacles in a larger
surroundings. At even larger distances, the source density is assumed to
be too low and thus the cells are incompetent for tentacle formation. Taking
together, basic pattern formation in hydra requires at least three pattern
forming systems: the hypostome (green), the tentacle system (red) and the
foot system (black). All three systems are coupled to each other by the
source density (or competence, blue). As shown in the following simulation,
such a combined system is able to generate the correct arrangement of these
structures even from near-homogeneous initial conditions:</font>

<p><img SRC="m-hy.gif" height=112 width=299></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This simulation above corresponds to the
regeneration of a small fragment of the body column. As in the natural
situation, after formation of all structures the system is able to grow
substantially without initiation of further structures</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As described in detail in the book (page
212, Fig. 12.6) this model correctly describes a remarkable observation.
With tentacle-specific antibodies, Bode et al. (1988) have shown that after
head removal tentacle activation first reappears at the very tip of the
gastric column (red in the drawing below).&nbsp; First the patch becomes
larger and the center de-activated. Somewhat later this ring-shaped activation
shifts towards the final, slightly more basal position and disintegrates
into separate patches. These local signals coincide with the actual tentacle
formation.</font>
<center><img SRC="hybode2.gif" height=113 width=317></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The model reproduces this observation. The
following simulations starts with the situation given above. Note that
first the tentacle signal (red) appears at the apical end of the fragment.
After the trigger of the hypostome signal (green) it becomes displaced:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="m-hyr-h.gif" height=112 width=299></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to the model, since tentacles
are formed close together, the tentacle inhibitor need not diffuse very
far. This is in contrast to the inhibitor for the primary organizing region
that has to diffuse through the whole body column to prevent the formation
of additional heads. Thus, after removal of the head and the tentacles,
the tentacle inhibitor fades away more rapidly than the head inhibitor.
The tentacle activator can reappear sooner than the head activator. Since
initially no suppressing head activator is present, this happens at the
highest possible source density (blue), i.e., at the apical end of the
fragment. After the trigger of the primary head activation (green) at the
same position, tentacle activation becomes shifted to the final location.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was a prediction of the model that the
system behaves differently in fragments derived from tissue closer to the
foot. There, the competence for tentacle formation must be insufficient
for a direct trigger. This is necessary since the tentacles appear close
to each other. Therefore, that most of the gastric column is free of tentacles
is not caused by a long-ranging inhibitory influence of the existing tentacles
but result from the insufficient competence for tentacle formation. Thus,
since a tentacle signal cannot be formed directly, the system has to wait
until first the hypostome signal appears. Under its influence, the competence
(blue) increases. If a certain level is reached, the signal for tentacle
is triggered. Since the hypostome signal is then already present, the tentacle
signal can only appear at their final positions:</font>
<center><img SRC="m-hyr-f.gif" height=112 width=299></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As an approximation of the apical dome,
the following simulations demonstrate formation of the tentacle signal
in a two-dimensional field. The left simulation shows the situation with
an initially high source density (blue, bottom profile): first a central
tentacle signal (red) is formed that splits after the trigger of the head
signal (green). This is the situation shown in the drawing above. In the
simulation on the right, the source density is initially lower. First the
hypostome signal appears that becomes subsequently surrounded by the ring
of tentacles. A transient stage is a ring-shaped activation that disintegrates
into several spots. There is never a central local activation as occurring
during regeneration of an apical fragment. Recent expression studies with
a Hydra homologue of the <i>aristaless
</i>gene (Smith et al., Development
127, 4743; 2000) have provided further support of the model.</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This model also accounts for the sequence
of events in bud formation as distinct from that in head formation. Bud
formation occurs in the course of growth in the body column. A new signal
for head formation is generated in a region of <i>low </i>competence, a
region that is incompetent for tentacle formation. Thus, tentacle formation
is not allowed right away. It was expected, therefore, that first the hypostome
signal is formed that rises subsequently the competence, creating in this
way the precondition for the tentacle formation (corresponding to the simulation
above right). The observations mentioned above have provided evidence for
this prediction.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The figure below left shows a hydra with
three buds in different stages. The simulations at right show the formation
of a new head signal during growth in the body column and the subsequent
induction of a tentacle signal.</font>
