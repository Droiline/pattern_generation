<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ernst Heackel noticed already in 1874 that
during development all higher organisms proceed through a cup-shaped tissue
configuration he called ‘gastraea’, suggesting that this is close to the
appearance of a common ancestor. Neglecting the tentacles, Hydra can be
presumably regarded as a living fossil that maintains this cup-shaped structure
when full-grown. The figure left below shows a drawing of an early developmental
stage of <i>Amphioxus</i>, a lower vertebrate, in comparison with a Hydra,
both consisting of an ectodermal and endodermal cell layer::</font>
<center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thus, Hydra – or more general – the Cnidaria
– are assumed to be close to the common ancestor before bilaterality was
invented during evolution. However, the relation of the single axis in
hydra and the two major body axes in higher organisms remained unclear
for a long time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The modern tools of molecular biology have
provided an inroad. In 2000 Hobmayer et al. [2] demonstrated that in Hydra
patterning molecules are involved that have been shown before to play a
crucial role in organizer formation of higher organisms such as the frog:
&szlig;-catenin and WNT.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it remained unclear whether
the head-foot axis in Hydra is homologous to our anteroposterior axis.
Alternatively, it has been argued that the high nerve cell density in the
head of the Hydra corresponds to our neural side (spinal cord) such that
the single axis of hydra would be homologues to our back-to-belly axis.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A comparison of reported expression patterns
of homologous genes in hydra and in higher organisms at early stages of
their development led to a very surprising result [3]. The bottom of the
cup-shaped ancestor gave rise to the foot in Hydra and to the most anterior
part of higher organisms, the forebrain and heart. Thus the Hydra foot
and the forebrain of higher organisms have the same positional address.
In contrast, the opening of the gastric column forms the most posterior
structure. The so-called head in Hydra is, therefore, in reality not the
front but the rear end and corresponds to the anus of higher organisms.
The tentacle/hypostome border corresponds to the midbrain/hindbrain border

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Later in evolution the trunk has been sequentially
intercalated into a narrow zone next to the gastric opening (yellow-red
border in the drawing above). Thus, the common ancestor of hydra and higher
organisms became almost entirely converted into our head and especially
the brain. The trunk provided the precondition to form segments, limbs
etc..</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To proceed from the radial symmetric to
a bilateral body plan, the crucial invention was the generation of a midline,
i.e., the reference point for the mediolateral&nbsp; patterning. In vertebrates,
this is the notochord. It controls the formation of many other structures
such as the spinal chord. Theoretical considerations revealed that the
generation of a single long extended structure is a difficult task. What
generates the asymmetry that the structure has a long extension in one
dimension but only a small in the other? Early removal of midline structures
in the chick embryo leads to their regeneration, showing that a the midline
structure is maintained by a dynamic pattern-foming process. As shown above,
saturation can lead to <a href="../2/2-7.htm#Stripes">stripe-like</a> patterns.
However, when initiated by random fluctuations, the stripes bend and bifurcate.
Straight stripes can be generated by the cooperation of a spot-producing
and a stripe–producing system: the spot system triggers the stripe system
while the stripe system repels the spot system [4]. In this way, the spot
system&nbsp;<a NAME="elongated stripes"></a>elongates the stripe system):</font>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is what happens during midline formation
in vertebrates: the organizer attracts cells of the ring-shaped margin
that forms the opening of the cup-shaped organism (or the ectoderm/endoderm
border; i.e., the marginal zone in the frog or the germ ring in the fish)&nbsp;
After being once close to the organizer, these cells become reprogrammed
and are no longer attracted. They are left behind the moving organizer.
In this way they form the midline, a process that&nbsp; is based on the
conversion of a ring- into a rod-like structure, including the most central
structure, the notochord:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="ring-rod.gif" height=113 width=627></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thus, the notochord&nbsp; - the reference
point for our mediolateral organization - is generated by sequential elongation
in the course of time. In contrast, the mechanism for midline formation
in insects is totally different [3]. There, a dorsal organizer does not
elongate but repels the midline, enforcing midline formation at the opposite
ventral side. This occurs more or less synchronously over the whole AP-extension
of, e.g., the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>&nbsp; and not by a sequential
elongation as&nbsp; in vertebrates. Therefore, during evolution, starting
from radial-symmetric animals, presumably two very the different modes
to generate bilateral-symmetric organisms were invented.</font>
