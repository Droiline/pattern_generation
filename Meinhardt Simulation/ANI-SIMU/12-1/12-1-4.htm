<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the simulations on the preceding page,
an organizing region was inducing a neighboring structure. The hypostome
of a hydra, the cone-shaped structure around the opening of the gastric
column, and the adjacent tentacles have been used as example. Experimental
observations indicate that both the primary and the secondary structure
are controlled by separate pattern-forming systems. Such a chain of inductions
is not necessarily limited to two structures, since the induced structure
can become again the inducing region for a subsequent structure. In the
following it is shown that several activator-inhibitor systems can be linked
to each other. Each structure has an activating influence on the formation
of the adjacent structures. Locally, however, these structures exclude
each other. Such systems are able to generate sequences of particular signals
for differentiation in space. The resulting patterns show a very good size
regulation over a wide range and are able to regenerate missing parts.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the following simulation four coupled
activator-inhibitor systems are assumed. A slight advantage of the `blue`
system determines only the polarity of the resulting pattern. The sequence
itself ('blue, green, red, brown) is fixed by strength of the mutual activations
(see box). The fourfold subdivision of the field is stable over substantial
growth.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With the removal of a portion of the field,
some of the activated regions are removed too or become much reduced in
size. The decreasing levels of the corresponding inhibitors enforce regulation.
In the simulation below, the right part of the field has been removed.
The correct sequence is restored in the much smaller field. This occurs
in a sequential way (first red, then brown):</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The left part would regenerate as well.
In the simulation below, after removal of the middle part, regeneration
takes place as well:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, a mutual activation of several
pattern-forming systems that are locally exclusive allows the generation
of stable spatial sequence of structures. These show pattern regulation
over a wide range of initial conditions, can adapt to different field size
and are able to regulate after a perturbation.</font>

activator-inhibitor systems. All interactions&nbsp; are assumed to be of

of <i>a</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>g</i> on <i>c</i> activation leads to the
mutual exclusiveness. The <i>c</i> inhibition on the activation of its

activation and size regulation.</font>
