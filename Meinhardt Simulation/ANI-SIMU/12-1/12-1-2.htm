<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>Two organizing regions at
opposite sides of a field:</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+3>hydra head and foot formation
as example</font></font></center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In many embryonic fields
each terminal position carries a specific organizing region. Hydra is no
exception. In addition to the head on one side, the foot is formed at the
other. Which mechanism causes the two organizing regions to appear at opposite
positions? Simple cross-inhibition of a head system and a foot system is
not appropriate since in small (young) animals head and foot must appear
very close together. At such a short distance a direct mutual inhibition
between both systems would lead to the suppression of foot regeneration
by the nearby head.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It rather appears that
it is the competence introduced above that plays the crucial role in the
positioning of the two organizers. As mentioned, the competence for head
formation is a graded tissue property and the head signal stabilizes this
competence. We assume, therefore, that the foot system has the opposite
behavior: it appears in the region of lowest head-forming competence (lowest
source density; blue distribution in the simulations). Thus, the foot signal
(black in the simulation) forms at the maximum distance from the head signal
(green). In small animals the head and the foot system can coexist at a
close neighborhood since there is no direct inhibition between the two
centers. The graded source density only generates a <i>preference
</i>for
the terminal positions. In the simulation below, after removal of the foot,
a new foot signal (black) regenerates close to the head signal. The trigger
of the new foot signal is without any influence on the head signal (during
the regeneration, the foot inhibitor is shown as a brown line):</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second organizer
is assumed to contribute to the maintenance of tissue polarity. While the
head signal appears, preferentially, at the region of highest competence
and increases the competence, the foot signal has the opposite properties:
it appears at the lowest head competence and lowers this competence even
further. Low competence for head formation is equivalent to a high competence
for foot formation. The foot enhances this foot-competence by lowering
the competence for head formation.</font>
