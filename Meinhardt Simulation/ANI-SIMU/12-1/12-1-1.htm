maintenance of single organizing regions in growing embryos</font></font></center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As mentioned, a maximum
generated by&nbsp; local self-enhancement and long-range inhibition has
many properties of an <a href="../2/2-6.HTM">organizing region (chapter
2)</a>. In small fields, the maximum appears at one border of the field.&nbsp;
Either the graded activator or inhibitor profile can provide positional
information. However, if the region in which the pattern formation takes
place grows, multiple maxima will emerge. The graded pattern will change
into a symmetric and ultimately into a periodic pattern:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="m-pol-pe.gif" height=122 width=280></center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Growth is, however, the
standard situation for a developing embryo. Multiple maxima would lead
to several organizing regions instead of one and thus possibly to the formation
of several partially fused and malformed embryos.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A single maximum can
be stabilized if cells distant to an established maximum loose the ability
to perform the pattern forming reaction. This ability we have called source
density (blue in the simulations below). It corresponds to the observable
feature of competence. Thus, an activator maximum is assumed to have a
positive and long-ranging feedback on the competence, accomplished, for
instance, by a secondary morphogen that controls the source density. Cells
distant to a maximum loose the competence. The induction of additional
organizing regions becomes less likely. In this way, a single organizing
region can be maintained, even when after substantial growth the size of
the field exceeds the range of the inhibition. This has also the consequence
that even very small fragments are able to regenerate:</font>
<center><img SRC="comp6b.gif" height=201 width=614>
<p>(Note that in contrast to the color-coding used in the book, in this
simulation, blue is used for the competence.
<br>This change was necessary to maintain green as the color for the activator
distribution, inhibitor shown as red line)</center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During regeneration,
those cells that were originally closer to the organizing region have an
advantage to win the competition due to their higher competence. In other
words, the tissue obtains an intrinsic polarity. Regeneration of an organizing
region will occur at a predictable position. This head start accelerates
the formation of a new organizer significantly since a symmetry breaking
is no longer required. Even if the tissue looks overtly uniform, it is
not. The simulation above shows the maintenance of a single organizing
region during growth and the regeneration according the original polarity.
Note that during regeneration remains nearly unchanged. Afterwards it takes
time to restore the normal source density (blue) near the newly formed
organizing region.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This property of the
model fits with the observation in Hydra. A fragment always forms the new
head at side pointing in the direction of the original head, the so-called
apical side. Depending on the precise position of a cut, the same cells
of the gastric region can either form a head, a foot or maintain the character
of the body column:</font>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation
shows that a secondary maximum could form if the competence would not decline
steeply enough with increasing distance from the organizer:</font></div>

<center><img SRC="comp6a.gif" height=201 width=634></center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to this model,
an organizing region has two conflicting influences on the surrounding
tissue. On the one hand it prevents the formation of additional organizing
regions in the surrounding tissues by the long-ranging inhibitory effect.
On the other hand, it also has an activating influence by keeping surrounding
cells competent. Why do not both effects simply cancel each other? The
two effects have different time constants (see box). The inhibition is
a rapid process: after (partial) removal of an organizing region, the inhibition
has to decay rapidly in order that regulation can occur. In contrast, competence
should have a much longer time constant. It should remain almost unchanged
at the time scale required for pattern regulation.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the following simulation,
competence is assumed to decline more strongly with increasing distance
from the organizer. A distant fragment is no longer able to regenerate
while fragments derived from regions closer to the original organizer have
a better chance. This is a well-known property of many organizing regions
in higher organisms.</font>
<center><img SRC="Comp6c.gif" height=201 width=614></center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In conclusion, not only
the formation of a pattern is an important step. To make development reproducible
and to suppress malformations it is also essential that the capability
to form a particular pattern fades away at the correct later stage.</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Likewise, the competence could be also
under control of the inhibitor. The long-range of the latter is convenient
to generate the shallow gradient of the source density. Then, however,
to avoid an overall explosion of the system, higher levels in the source
density have to slow down a further increase (last equation at left. A
diffusion of a molecule controlling the source density is then no longer
required.</font></td>
