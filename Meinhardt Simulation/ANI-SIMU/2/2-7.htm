<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Pattern formation in two-dimensional field</font></h1></center>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Graded distributions emerge also in sheets
of cells if the range of the activator is comparable with the field size.
In a near circular field and&nbsp; in the absences of external asymmetries,
a high concentration appears at an arbitrary marginal position. Again,
the field obtains a polarity. A graded distribution emerges along one axis
while perpendicular to the steepest slope the concentrations are roughly
constant:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="xyd-r.gif" height=299 width=279></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In a sheet with an elongated geometry,
it is a property of the system that the gradient forms along the largest
extension of the field. The highest and lowest activator concentration
appear at the most remote positions:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="xyd-ap.gif" height=246 width=259></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is presumably important for pattern
formation in single cells. In many dividing cells, the division plane is
formed perpendicular to their longest extension. Our pattern-forming mechanism
allows detecting the largest extension of an elongated structure.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the field size is larger than the range
of the inhibitor, multiple maxima emerge. If initiated by random fluctuations,
the spacing is not very regular but a maximum and minimum spacing is maintained.</font></div>

<center><img SRC="27b.gif" id="_x0000_i1025" height=383 width=386></center>

<p><br>
<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While usually pattern
formation on shells is a one-dimensional process, on some shells two-dimensional
patterning plays a role. These shells are covered with the <i>periostracum</i>
– a protrusion of the ectoderm of the mollusk. These two protrusions meet
somewhere on the shell opposite to the opening, leading to the seam-like
line that is clearly visible on the shells shown below. A pattern generated
in this cell sheet is copied to the underlying shell. This is therefore
a two-dimensional patterning process, leading to very different types of
patterns.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<p><img SRC="27r.jpg" BORDER=0 id="_x0000_i1026" height=209 width=342></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On some shells, pattern formation proceeds
at early stages of the mollusk in the space-time mode mentioned above.
At adult stages, however, a transition occurs into the two-dimensional
mode. Although formed on a single shell, both patterns have a very different
character. The shell of <i><a href="../4/4-3.htm">Cypraea diluculum</a></i>
is an example The left shell has a typical space-time pattern, in contrast
to the dot-like pattern around the shell opening visible on the right shell:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="palma2.jpg" height=206 width=304></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If pattern formation in a two-dimensional
field is initiated by local perturbations, the resulting patterns can be
more regular. In the simulation below, a small elevation in the center
forms the first maximum. The concomitantly produced inhibitor (not shown)
leads to a deactivation in the surroundings. Beyond the range of the inhibitor,
a rim of high concentration forms that decays into individual peaks:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="27a.gif" id="_x0000_i1027" height=163 width=255></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If the autocatalysis saturates at some
maximal level of local activation, preferentially stripes are formed. Since
initiated by random fluctuations, these stripes have no preferential orientation;
they meander and bifurcate. With saturation the activated regions enlarge.
Since lateral inhibition is still at work, activated regions require non-activated
regions in the neighborhood into which the inhibitor can diffuse. These
to features seem to exclude each other.&nbsp;<a NAME="Stripes"></a>Stripes,
however, satisfies both requirements since activated cells have activated
neighbors and non-activated cells are nearby into which the inhibitor can
escape:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="27c.gif" id="_x0000_i1028" height=140 width=140></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Midline formation of
higher, bilateral-symmetric organism require the formation of a <a href="../12-1/12-1-5.htm#elongated stripes">single
straight stripe.</a>&nbsp; This can be achieved by a cooperation of stripe-forming
and a spot forming mechanism.</font>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The formation of the
stripes requires some diffusion of the activator, enforcing that at least
some neighbors of an activated cell becomes also activated. Without this
diffusion-based community effect but still with saturation, a salt-and-pepper
distribution will result. Activation will become an all-or-nothing event.
The number of activated cells is a certain portion of the total number
of cells. Such a mechanism allows for the generation of differentiated
cells in a regulated proportion but in an intermingled arrangement. The
prestalk cells in the slime mold <i>Dictyostelium discoidem </i>are an
example. Due to the saturation, there is no minimum spacing between the
activated cells although lateral inhibition is involved:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="salt-pe.gif" height=130 width=139></center>


<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following example
shows a simple model for phyllotaxis. Assumed is a cylindrical array of
cells that grows at its upper end. First a maximum is formed in the ring-shaped
growth zone, providing a signal for leaf initiation. Whenever newly formed
cells in the growth zone obtained sufficient distance from the existing
leaf primordia, a new signal is triggered. In this case, leaves appear
in a 180 degree position. Helical arrangements of leaves suggest, however,
that the mechanism is more complex (see&nbsp;<a NAME="phyllotaxis"></a><a href="../12-4/12-4-1.htm">phyllotaxis</a>).</font>
