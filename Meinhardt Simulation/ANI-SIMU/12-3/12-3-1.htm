<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Structures consisting of long filaments
that branch are very frequent in development. Nerve nets,&nbsp; blood vessels,
tracheae in insects and&nbsp; the veins of leaves are examples (below from
left to right&nbsp; [1]). The elements can consist of single very long
extended cells (as in nerves) or of long chains of differentiated cells
(as in leaves).</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="82-net.gif" height=264 width=711></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to the model proposed, filaments
appear like traces behind local signals that wander over the field.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="netgen.gif" height=186 width=194></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the simulation above, it is assumed
that local signals are generated by an activator - inhibitor system (red
spots). When these signals are above a certain threshold, the exposed cells
differentiate into members of the filament system (blue squares). Differentiated
cells repel the signal, causing in this way their shift into a neighboring
region. These cells also differentiate and the filament becomes elongated,
and so on. To orient the elongation into a region not supplied by filaments,
all cells are supposed to produce a substrate (green in the simulation
above, brown in the simulation below) that is removed by the differentiated
cells. The substrate concentration is a measure of how urgently the cells
need additional veins or filaments, for instance, in order to remove an
oxygen deficiency. Due to the activator-inhibitor mechanism, there is a
competition along the filament. Those regions will win that contain the
highest substrate concentration, causing a corresponding elongation. This
is usually the tip region of a filament. In the following simulation the
distributions of the four substances involved are plotted.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="line-geb.gif" height=257 width=227>
<p>green/red: activator-inhibitor system that produces the signal for the
new differentiation
<br>brown: substrate removed by the differentiated cells. Activator signal
is shifted towards higher substrate concentrations
<br>blue: state of cell differentiation, high = member of the vessel system</center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The simulation above also shows how branches
are formed. A basic activator production in the differentiated cells can
lead to a trigger of a new maximum along an existing filament whenever
the level of the local inhibitor concentration becomes low enough. This
is the case if other elongation points are sufficiently remote and if sufficient
substrate is available.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many net-like structures are able to regulate.
Filaments in the non-damaged neighborhood start branching and filaments
grow in into the damaged region to repair the defect. Pattern regulation
after a damage in a tracheal network is&nbsp; an example:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="wig-r.gif" height=156 width=503></center>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<center>Repair of a damaged net (drawn after [2,1]). (a) The tracheal system
in the ventral abdomen of a normal, undamaged bug. (b) Oxygen supply to
the fourth segment is disrupted by cutting the corresponding trachea (broken
line, site marked by the arrow in Fig. a). Oxygen-deprived epithelial cells
attract new filaments to repair the damage. In this way, the oxygen supply
but not the natural pattern is restored</center>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the model, after removal of some
filaments, the substrate is no longer removed and the rising substrate
concentration attracts activator maxima from the non-injured region. The
regenerated pattern is similar but not identical to the original one, demonstrating
that not the final pattern but the mode of generation is controlled.</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="netregn.gif" height=191 width=191></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several factors are known that play a role
in the determination of final density of the net. For instance, a tumor
can only grow if it is able to attract new blood vessels for its nourishment.
In contrast, in cartilage vessels disappear, contributing to the white
appearance of that tissue. In an experiment by Folkman [3], a piece of
tumor tissue was implanted into a rabbit retina. It attracted new vessels
(below right). If, however, between the tumor (T) and the existing vessels
a piece of cartilage (C) is implanted, the cartilage repels newly formed
vessels (left).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="folk-dra.gif" height=201 width=405>
<br>(drawn after [3])</center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is reproduced by the model. In the
simulation shown below, an increased substrate production (higher bc in
the equation above) is assumed in the upper half of the field. It leads
to an attraction of new vessels and to an increased vessel density. In
contrast, an elevated level of constitutive inhibitor production (bb) in
the center (darker square) repels the ingrowth of veins. They circumvent
this region:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="folkm.gif" height=338 width=510></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In leaf venation, frequently branches from
the midrib are formed on alternating sides. The example below shows that
this rule is mostly but not strictly obeyed:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="lr-alter.jpg" height=260 width=362></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to the model, whether a branch
is formed towards one side or the other depends on minute fluctuations.
However, if a branch has been formed, let us say, to the right, the next
branch will probably point to the left due to the substrate removal by
the first branch. On some leaves there are cases where branches to both
sides have their origin at the same position of the midrip. According to
the model, this can occur if the initiating maximum splits and give rise
to two traveling signals, one to each side. The alternation in the branching
direction can be seen in the two simulations below. If the details of a
pattern depend on fluctuations but each step has a strong influence on
forthcoming decisions, the actual pattern will be unpredictable. Indeed,
the venation of two leaves on the same tree is never identical although
they are certainly formed under control of the same genetic information.
The variability is reproduced in the simulations:</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is a feature of this version of the
model that the filaments of networks end mostly blind. This is in agreement
with the lymph vessels and tracheae. Other systems, however, form frequently
anastomoses. The veins of the leaves in higher plants form such reconnections:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="leaf-con.jpg" height=284 width=453></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The exact mechanism is still an open problem.
Reconnections were presumably a major achievement during plant evolution
since evolutionary earlier plants such as the Ginkgo didn't have them.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The many veins on the wings of dragon flies
(below, right) consist of closed loops only. Also the early plexus of blood
vessels in vertebrates consist of such loops. A possible mechanism to create
such a pattern is a combination of a spot and a stripe system: The spots
act as a system of inhibitory islands dictating where <i>no </i>filaments
are to be formed [4].&nbsp; Closed nets of filaments arise at the maximum
distance from the inhibiting spots. The regions that are free of vessels
are, therefore, assumed to play an active role. This is in agreement with
the shaping of the vessels by growing holes in the plexus during blood
vessel formation [5]. In the following simulation, the spot-system is shown
in blue. It has an inhibiting influence on a stripe-forming system (red).
To illustrate the closed loops more clearly, in the last part of the sequence
the spots are no longer drawn.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Closed loops also can be found in some
fungi. The figure below shows an example:</font>
