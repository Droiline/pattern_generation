<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is known since long that chemotactic
cells and growth cones maintain their dynamic cell changes even in the
absence of external signals. This was an essential reason to assume that
not only an amplification of an external asymmetry takes place but also
that the cells have an internal patterning system. This enables a cell
to detect minute concentration differences but also cause that in the absence
of a signal, e.g., random fluctuation are sufficient to initiate the cell-internal
patterning.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A very remarkable observation of group
of Michael Vicker was that in the slime mould <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i>
these shape changes are by no means random.&nbsp; In terms of the model,
in the absence of an external signal the cells are so sensitive that the
remnants of the poisoning antagonist are sufficient for orientation. Therefore,
a once formed protrusion influences the subsequent one and are, therefore,
not random. Two modes are especially frequent. In the first, protrusions
stretch out at two opposing sides. After their retraction a new pair results
with a 90&deg; orientation with respect to the preceding one. The following
figures show the outline of an isolated cell in 3s interval:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The second mode leads to protrusions that
move around the cells in a wave-like manner. The cell seems to rotate.</font>

<br>(after Killich et al., 1994: Biosystems 33, 75-87)</center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first mode corresponds to the out-of-phase
oscillation, the second to the traveling wave mode, both discussed above
for particular shell patterns. It was shown that small changes of parameters
are sufficient for a transition from one mode to the other. Below are the
corresponding simulations of the <a href="../5/5-3.htm">shell patterns</a>:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation shows the pattern
formation on a ring using the same equation and essentially the same constants.
Assumed is an oscillating activator-depleted substrate system (green-gray).
The diffusible inhibitor (red) has likewise also a long time constant.
The size of the 'cell' is such that two peaks are possible. The long-lasting
poisoning leads to break down of the peaks at&nbsp;<a NAME="opposite"></a>opposite
positions and the next trigger appears at 90&deg;. Even after starting
from a homogeneous situation, this mode is rapidly attained.</font>
<center><img SRC="vic-coun.gif" height=325 width=321></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">With a slightly higher rate of substrate production,
the maxima become more stable. They do not break down but become shifted
into a neighboring position. The locally rising inhibitor also causes there
a poisoning, enforcing a further shift, and so on. The result is a rotating
pattern, in full agreement with the observation:</font>
