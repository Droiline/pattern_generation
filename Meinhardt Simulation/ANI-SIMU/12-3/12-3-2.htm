<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the previous page is has been described
that long filaments of differentiated cells can be generated by a moving
signal that leaves behind filaments of differentiated cells. However, in
many cases, the filaments are formed by long extensions of single cells.
The three pictures below are from a time laps movie showing the extension
of a nerve cell in tissue culture. The growth cone at the tip is known
to sense directional signals for the orientation of further growth. Another
example are the pollen cells in plants that extend long tubes to achieve
fertilization.</font></div>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Similarly, many cells are able to move
as a whole toward a target region. Leukocytes, for instance, have to move
to an inflammation site. Cells of <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> move
toward each other in the case of foot shortage. In all these cases signaling
substances are involved. Concentration differences of a few percent across
a cell or a growth cone are sufficient for the chemotactic orientation.
How it is possible for such minute concentration differences to be detected
by the cells?</font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Time-lapse
movies such as those shown above demonstrate that this orientation is based
on highly dynamic processes. Protrusions are stretched out and retracted
in a seemingly irregular way. Many cell types show such dynamic behavior
even in the absence of external signals, arguing for mechanisms in which
a pattern formation mechanism exists within the cells. The orientation
of the internal pattern is oriented by the external signal. This internal
pattern causes a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and changes in the cell
shape. Only the generation of this internal pattern in the response to
external gradients is described by the model.</font>
<br>&nbsp;

<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>An
activator-inhibitor system is able to detect minute differences: </b>In
the first simulation, it is shown that an activator-inhibitor interaction
is very sensitive against imposed asymmetries. Assumed is that an external
signal (blue) has an asymmetry of 2% over the cell diameter. It has an
activating influence on the activator autocatalysis. Despite the fact that
1% random fluctuation in each space element of the cell surface blurs this
minute signal, the system is sensitive enough to detect this asymmetry.
A local high activator maximum (green) emerges at the side pointing to
the highest concentration (black arrow). The self-enhancement is antagonized
by the rapidly spreading inhibitor (red):</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="origmn.gif" BORDER=0 id="_x0000_i1025" height=182 width=182></center>


<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The
second sequence in this simulation shows that the orientation also works
with a much smaller absolute level of the external signal (smaller blue
circle). This is essential for an orientation in a field that uses graded
concentration profiles as guiding cues.&nbsp; However, as shown in the
third sequence, after an establishment of a strong internal signal, even
a much stronger and more asymmetric external signal (eccentric blue circle
above) <i>is<b> unable</b></i> to reorient the once established cell-internal
pattern (note that the cell copes with the higher external signal by increasing
inhibitor level shown in red).</font>

<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>An
established internal signal has to be quenched to maintain the sensitivity:
</b>Thus
the problem is not the detection of the minute signals but the maintenance
of the sensitivity towards varying directions of the orienting signal.
For this, the internal signals have to disappear in order to give new maxima
the chance to arise at a more appropriate position. One possibility is
the use of an oscillating patterning system. Such system cycles through
a phase in which it is sensitive to an external asymmetry, followed by
a phase in which the imposed internal asymmetry is amplified, culminating
in a strongly localized signal. The subsequent accumulation of the inhibitor
leads to a collapse of the activation. After decay of the inhibitor, the
system enters again into the sensitive phase in which a new direction can
be chosen. <a href="../3/31.htm">Oscillations</a> do occur if the inhibitor
has a longer half-life than the activator:</font>

<div style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Several
problems remain in such a system. Frequently there is more than one protrusion
formed at the time and they are not formed in synchrony. At a given time
some protrusions stretch out while others retract. Moreover, the model
above would predict short phases in which the cell is sensitive to the
external gradient followed by relatively long phases in which the cell
is insensitive. This is in contrast to the observation that, e.g., Dictyostelium
cells maintain continuously their sensitivity. Moreover, the simple oscillating
system of pattern formation works only in a small range of parameters since
lateral inhibition requires an overall activation in order that the competition
can work. The solution is a separation of the antagonistic reaction that
accomplishes lateral inhibition and the antagonistic reaction that causes
the disappearance of the once established maxima.</font></div>

<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Without
fluctuations, the cell-internal signal appears at a coherent region (left);
with fluctuations (right), several maxima can appear. Those regions that
have the best condition due to the combined action of the external signal
and the fluctuations will win. Generally, the patterns of protrusions depend
on the strength of the signal, on the activator diffusion and on the degree
of the saturation of the activator autocatalysis.</font>

<p style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>A
permanent sensitivity results from a finite half-life of the 'hot spots'
</b>[1]<b>:
</b>In order to account for the flexibility of the system in
response to changing directional signals, the saturating system has to
be supplemented by a quenching mechanism. This is introduced by a second
antagonistic reaction that acts locally and that has a long time constant.
It causes a destabilization of once formed maxima. Since the total activated
area is regulated, any local maximum that disappears makes place for a
new one. It can emerge at a position governed by the external signal. The
result is a permanent creation of hot spots at the side exposed to the
highest signal concentration and their disappearance after a certain time
interval. In the simulation below, a concentration difference of 2% across
the cell and 1% random fluctuation is assumed. Despite the blurring effect
of the fluctuation, it is clear that the overall direction is correctly
detected, even after a change of the gradient.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This formation of hot spots as signals for
stretching out protrusions will continue even in the absence of an external

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thus, a system consisting of one autocatalytic
reaction that is balanced by two antagonistic reactions with different
time constants and different spreading allows the generation of local activated
regions on the cell cortex, which are highly sensitive towards external
signals. The system is able to detect minute external asymmetries and can
permanently adapt to changing directions and absolute levels. In the absence
of external asymmetries, nevertheless local signals are generated. This
leads even the absence of any graded cues to a dynamic regulation of protrusions.
An example will be given on the next page.</font>
