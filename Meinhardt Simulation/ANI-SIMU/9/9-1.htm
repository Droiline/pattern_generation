<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shells shown above are decorated with
many fine parallel lines. This suggests that synchronous oscillations took
place. At particular positions, however, these parallel lines are interrupted
and form U- or V- shaped gaps.&nbsp; Such 'tongues' result from the temporary
suspension of otherwise almost synchronous oscillations. A non-pigmented
area results that is re-pigmented from neighboring regions in which oscillations
survived. The V- or U-shaped oblique lines that border the tongues indicate
that traveling waves move into the regions of interrupted oscillations,
filling the gaps by revitalizing the oscillations. After two such waves
meet, normal oscillation usually continues, at least for a certain interval.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An important hint in determining the underlying
mechanism comes from a background pigmentation that is visible on some
shells. As can be seen on the shells shown below, the background pigmentation
exists between the parallel lines but is absent in the tongues. After the
last pulse of the pigmentation system before the onset of tongue formation,
the gray background pigmentation is still present for a time that is comparable
with the cycle time of the oscillating system:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Based on this background pattern, the following
mechanism was proposed: the background system is a prerequisite for the
oscillating system. The oscillating system, in turn, acts to refresh the
background system. When a pulse of the oscillating system appears too late,
the background system and thus the prerequisite for the sustained oscillations
switches off. After each pulse, some sort of race takes place. Only if
the next pulse is not too late, it can accomplish the refresh. The mutual
dependence of a steady state system and an oscillating system may be illustrated
with an analogy. The living state of a higher organism depends on a beating
heart. But the heart can only beat if the organism is alive. If a single
heartbeat comes too late, the organism may die. Of course, if the organism
dies for other reasons, the heart will also stop beating. Such a mechanism
would predict that if a subsequent pulse comes somewhat&nbsp;<a NAME="later"></a>later,
the danger for a breakdown would increase. This is clearly visible on the
following shell (see arrows):</font>
