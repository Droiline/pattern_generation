lines into bands</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The restriction of the parallel lines into
bands is a characteristic feature of many Clithon shells. Oblique lines
frequently connected these bands. Obviously some stable pattern exists
that allows synchronous oscillations only in particular regions.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One way to model this is to assume a higher
production rate of the poison (parameter <i>be </i>in equation given below).
Under this condition, the activation of the precondition pattern is too
short to allow several oscillations. Isolated oblique lines (traveling
waves) are still possible in such regions. They have their origin in one
of the parallel lines. Below the top part of the simulation above is shown
in an animated form.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Clithon, isolated oblique lines usually
don’t branch. This is in strong contrast, for instance, to the pattern
on <i><a href="../7/7-5.htm">Conus textile</a></i> where, outside of the
parallel lines, branching is a characteristic feature. According to the
model, the oblique lines in Clithon result from a wave-like spread of both
the precondition and the pigmentation system. In contrast, in patterns
with branching, the oblique lines are formed by one system only. The occasional
triggering of the second system causes the formation of a branch (compare
the black-green line in simulation above with the <a href="../7/7-5.htm#mesh">green
dots along black lines</a> in the branching pattern). In the present patterning
system, when the precondition remains active for a sufficiently long period,
the result is not a branch but two or more successive parallel lines.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The spatial restriction of the pigmentation
pattern may be so strong that even traveling waves are no longer possible:</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The shell below shows in addition a very
interesting phenomenon. The background pigmentation is modulated, indicating
that a global oscillation exists, as discussed in the previous chapter
dealing with triangle formation. Also this shell shows triangles. Thus,
the two types patterns are presumably more closely related.&nbsp; This
awaits further analysis.</font>
