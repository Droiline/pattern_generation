patterning</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <i>Clithon</i> shells show huge pattern
diversity. Many of these patters still wait for an appropriate simulation.
Some of the shells below have shown earlier to justify the model approach.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first three shells below illustrate
that the oscillation frequency can be very different, ranging from a steady
state and thus of a homogeneous covering with pigment to a wider spacing.
On the right shell, the horizontal lines almost merge to a homogeneous
light-colored background and only the borders of the tongues are stronger
pigmented.</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The pattern forming system can have a different
susceptibility for the interruption of the synchronous oscillations and
gap formation. On the shell at left, only rarely gaps are formed and this
restricted to particular zones. In contrast, at the shell at right, tongue
formation occurs in rapid succession.</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The restriction of the synchronous oscillations
to particular regions can be profound. On the left shell, these zones are
connected with oblique lines. On the central cells, were this oblique lines
meet, the pigmentation becomes reduced and of different color. At the right
shell, these connections no longer exist.</font>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After tongue formation, the regions in
which the oscillation takes place, enlarges. A traveling wave (oblique
line) paves the area in which oscillations become possible again. The triangular
shape of the pigmented regions on the left shell has also this origin.
This alternation between spread and retraction is the same as discussed
above for moving gaps, where the spread can take place on one side of the
tongue while on the other retraction occurs (shell in the center). The
alternation between spread and retraction is not obligatory. It occurs
in a marginal band on the shell at right but not in the central band. The
shell at left shows also that formation of oblique lines (traveling waves)
can still proceed when parallel lines (synchronous oscillations) are no
longer possible.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Within different bands, the pigmentation
may differ dramatically. On both shells below, the marginal bands are completely
filled while the central regions show the usual patterns of parallel lines
and gaps:</font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="cloll-8.jpg" height=255 width=260>&nbsp;<img SRC="cloll-3.jpg" BORDER=0 height=255 width=264></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After a larger gap has been formed, the
pigment system may be able to proceed only through a few oscillations.
This is the case in a particular region on the shell at left, leading to
the repetition of one or a few fine lines after a gap. In terms of the
model, the precondition for the oscillation is restored only for a short
period. On the shell in the center, a larger gap is followed a very thick
black region. From the model it is expected that during the arrest of the
oscillation in the gap-phase, the cell becomes more excitable. Either an
inhibitor decreases to very low level or the substantial accumulation of
a substrate could be responsible for the increased excitability. That the
activation within the traveling wave during gap closure is stronger than
those in the synchronous oscillations is also visible on the shell at right.
While the oblique lines are black, the weaker pigmentation of the parallel
lines leads to a change in color, from black to red or pink.</font>
