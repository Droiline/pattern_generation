<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the following simulations, the precondition
pattern is plotted in green. Oscillations can occur only if the precondition
is in the ON-state. The rapid spread of the pigment system leads to the
synchronization of the oscillation. Nevertheless it takes time to close
a gap since this requires the activation of the precondition system, which
is a time-consuming process. Thus, this model reconciles the rapid spread
as required for the synchronization and the apparent slow spread for filling
the gaps.</font>

and the precondition system (green) at the growing edge. On the right the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What spaces tongue formation? On some shells
the tongues are arranged in a scattered way, on others they appear more
regular at staggered positions. The latter suggest that whenever a tongue
has been formed, some memory exists in the corresponding region that delays
the formation of the next tongue. During tongue formation a substance may
be produced that stabilizes subsequent oscillations. Alternatively, either
the oscillating or background system may produce a poison that eventually
leads to the breakdown of the precondition system before the next refresh
occurs. A decrease in oscillation frequency would have the same effect.
Occasionally a somewhat larger spacing between the parallel lines is visible
at the onset of tongue formation, arguing in favor of the latter possibility
(see <a href="9-1.htm#later">shell on the previous page</a>).&nbsp; In
the simulations shown above it is assumed that the precondition system
produces an additional long-lasting inhibitor. Its accumulation makes in
the course an abrupt breakdown of the precondition system more likely.
The existence of a regulatory mechanism can be deduced from the shell shown
below. The parallel lines follow so densely on each other that pigmentation
appears almost homogeneous. Under this condition an enhanced pigmentation
is visible. It has the appearance of a long faint shadow under each (<a NAME="almost ring shaped"></a>almost
ring-shaped) gap. Further gaps form only at the side or after the fading
of the shadows.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The probability of triggering a gap can
be modified by either by a change of the production rate or of the efficiency
of the poison (se in the equation below). A decrease in the efficiency
leads to fewer tongues (left), and vice versa (right).</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although many essential elements are correctly
reproduced, some problems in the simulations remain.&nbsp; For instance,
it was necessary to assume some diffusion of the substrate (b in the equation
above) to make the gap attractive for the pigment reaction. This has unwanted
consequences. At the moment the gaps are ready for closing, the waves become
weaker due to the lateral inhibition resulting from the substrate diffusion.
A comparison with the real pattern shows that this is not correct. The
staggered character of the tongues is also less pronounced in the simulations
compared with the natural patterns. The natural patterns suggest that the
disappearance of the precondition pattern is abrupt. Therefore, in a model
the accumulating signal should have no influence on the pattern until the
actual breakdown takes place abruptly. How can such an accumulation proceed
for long without any overt manifestation? The same problem was accounted
in the simulation for <i><a href="../7/7-2.htm">Conus marmoreus</a></i>.
However, an active extinguishing reaction as used for
<i>Conus marmoreus
</i>is
unlikely to exist for the <i>Clithon </i>patterns.&nbsp; Finding a solution
for this problem was a crucial constraint in designing the interaction.</font>
