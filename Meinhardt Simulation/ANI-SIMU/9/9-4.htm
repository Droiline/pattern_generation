<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After tongue initiation, the next dark
pigmentation is usually involved to trigger the traveling wave that leads
to closure of the gap. Occasionally, however, several oscillations are
required before a traveling wave (oblique line) is formed. The arrows mark
such a situation on the shell below. .</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Usually, the size of the tongue starts
to shrink only after the traveling wave has been formed. This indicates
that the pigmentation system is needed to enlarge the zone in which the
precondition is in the ON-state. This view is supported by patterns that
display tongues that enlarge over time. This crumbling away takes place
only in regions where the tongues are not bordered by a traveling wave.
On some shells gaps are visible that enlarge on one side and shrink on
the other. Therefore, the tongues move in a wave-like manner.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The following simulation shows a moving
gap in a movie-like manner. It is the same simulation as shown above right
in the space-time plot. The retraction of precondition pattern (green)
after the formation of an initially small gap is clearly visible. After
the pigmentation system is triggered, the gap slowly closes. The elevated
production of the "poison" in the center (curve on top of simulation above
left) leads to the preferential gap formation in the center.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The moving gaps shed light on the interplay
between the two systems. On its own, the precondition system may have a
tendency to retract. In contrast, the pigmentation system has a tendency
to move into the gap since more substrate is available there. Gap formation
and its closure is thus a fight between the retraction of the precondition
system and the spread of the oscillating pigmentation system, pulling the
precondition system with it by its refresh function. Accordingly, the probability
of traveling gaps increases with a decrease in the rate of substrate diffusion,
since the attraction of pigmentation system towards the gap is lower. As
in the real pattern, only the lower side of such an oblique gap is bordered
by a dark oblique pigmentation line. It is the side in which the precondition
system becomes restored and this requires the help of the pigment system.
The movement of the gap terminates when the pigmentation system is also
triggered at the crumbling side, causing a bilateral spread into the gap
and thus its closure.</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the shell shown above, the gaps are
arranged in a fairly regular way. TMost of them have a nearly circular
shape. This is, however, not trivial. In the upper part of the circle,
a widening of the gap occurs. This depends on the speed of retraction of
the precondition pattern. In contrast, the lower half of the circle in
which the gap becomes narrower and ultimately closed, depends on the waves
that pull the precondition pattern behind. For the circular appearance,
both speeds must be roughly the same. The heavy dark line at the lower
half of the circle indicates that the activation in these traveling waves
occurs with some overshoot (for another shell with circular gaps <a href="9-2.htm#almost ring shaped">click
