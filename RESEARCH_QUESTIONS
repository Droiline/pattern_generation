"The *really* interesting question is then the extent to which these simple models reflect the actual biological mechanisms at work"

How simple can we get?

What can we achieve at different simplicities?

At what point does the increasing complexity not give us significantly more freedom with the patterns?

What point seems likely for real natural systems?

What use can we put this to?
